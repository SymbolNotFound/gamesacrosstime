This site is currently in development, the goal is to provide descriptions and
rule specifications for many games across various cultures and throughout time.
There is an interesting history to the origin of games and the many mechanisms
that have been developed independently (such as dice and cards) or carried by
travelers and traders to far-off lands (such as the long history of chess and
its variants).

It is being developed alongside a General Game Playing service and the plan is
to allow playing of games against a computer or other humans, knowing only the
game rules description.  There are more details in Symbol Not Found's github
repositories and the sibling site at ggpdojo.com where automated reasoning
agents may prove themselves against other state of the art AI systems.  In the
long term this site can provide a lineage of games by tracking game variants as
they are forked directly from existing games, and a managed service for game
designers and game artists to come together to create entirely new games.

Last updated in October 2024, come back soon for more!
