Arrangement Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the king + queen and another piece except the rooks. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the kings thus have been swapped, Black can now relocate the queen, if he so wishes. Next White relocates his queen and immediately starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules derive from Fischer Random Chess. White castles in the following way (the Black procedure is equivalent). When castling left (O-O-O) , the king moves to c1 and the rook moves to d1. When castling right (O-O) the king moves to g1 and the rook moves to f1. The following conditions must be true: the king must not move to, from or over an attacked square; the king and rook have never moved; there is no other piece on any square over which the king and rook move.","Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","Curtailed castling: in an alternative variant, if the king is positioned on the g or b file, castling is restricted to the side on which the king is positioned. The variant could be useful to enhance strategical predictability."],"image":"game1707_scr_ArrangementChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":8}

Unlike Fusion Chessgi, which is a straightforward hybrid of these two games, Assimilation Chess slightly changes the rules of Fusion Chess to create a game in which you can add to your own material by capturing enemy pieces. Instead of holding onto a captured piece for future deployment, you assimilate the captured piece into the capturing piece whenever the two pieces are non-identical simple pieces. For example, a Knight that captures a Rook becomes a Marshall, or a Rook that captures a Bishop becomes a Queen. When a simple piece captures a Pawn or a compound piece, or when a Pawn or compound piece captures anything, the capture does not change the capturing piece.  The game's name is inspired by the Borg from Star Trek, who regularly increase their numbers by assimilating their enemies. The object is the same as it is for Fusion Chess, to checkmate your opponent's current royal piece.  The board was made from computer generated textures.

{"zrfID":1179,"id":"bario","name":"Bario ","programmerID":380,"programmer":"Mats Winther","created":"2006-02-11","description":["In Bario the objective is to checkmate the opponent's King. You start with a King, eight pawns, and seven Quantum pieces, which are undefined, potential, pieces that, when they are put into use, must be defined as either Queen, Rook, Bishop or Knight. On your turn you can either move a regular piece with the usual chess rules or move one of your Quantum-pieces, which is at that moment transformed to a normal piece of your choice, provided that a piece of that type exists in the reserve.","When the pieces of one player have all been employed and there are only regular pieces of his colour on the board, then it's time to do a recycle. In this situation piece movement is prohibited and the only thing you can do is pressing the red button beside the board. This will cause all pieces on the board (except kings and pawns) to be substituted with Quantum pieces. The pieces on the board will be transferred to the reserve. The cycle now begins anew, and it's now possible to drop the pieces again. Also the other player must acknowledge the recycle by also pressing the red button. When, for one player, only pieces of one type (not counting kings and pawns) remain on the board, recycles will cease. However, if the transition to this state occurs simultaneously with transition to a recycle state, then the latter will take precedence. This glitch (?) might be fixed in a later version. The reason for the \"one-type\" rule is that the player with only one type of piece should not be of disadvantage, as his Quantums would be foreseeable. And, of course, if recycle didn't cease it wouldn't be possible to win with queen against lonely king.","If one party has made the mistake of initializing recycle when his king will be exposed to capture after recycle, one cannot press the red button, but will instead lose the game. This is acknowledged by moving the king off the board, which is similar to the old practice of felling the king when the situation is hopeless. Thus, the king cannot actually be captured. The program will sometimes give up if he will be checkmated after recycle.","Bario uses a special rule for Quantum capture. The program chooses a piece to be removed from the reserve and places it in the corner of the reserve. If you are happy with the choice then just play on. However, if you'd prefer to lose another piece then you must bring back the corner piece to your reserve by capturing another piece of yours which you would rather have removed. The opponent must acknowledge this procedure by pressing the red button.","Castling is possible with a Quantum on the corner square instead of a rook. It turns into a rook while castling.","Note that a Quantum can give check, too, provided that there exist pieces in the reserve that can threaten the enemy king. This means that the king must take measures immediately, just like it was a threat from a regular piece. This will feel unusual to the regular chessplayer."],"image":"game1179_scr_Bario.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

Normal chess rules apply. Instead of the regular pieces in the initial position, there exist \"shaman\" pieces (residing in a \"spiritual trance-state\"), that can travel directly to any empty square on the board. Alternatively, the shaman can directly be transformed to a piece from the regular piece set. Only the pawns and the kings are initially defined. Until the shaman has been defined as a real piece it cannot interact with other pieces, that is, cannot make captures. In order to transform a shaman (allow a shaman to leave the shamanic state and become a normal piece) the player must use up a move on the spot. You transform a shaman by pressing on the piece. A shaman can transform himself to any piece there remains to drop. The shaman is only mobile once. Hence it becomes immobile on the square where it has landed. So the only option is, later, to transform it to a normal piece. A mark on the shaman signals that !","it has  used up its move.","Castling is allowed with a shaman instead of a rook. Since the castled shaman has moved it cannot move again, but must later be transformed to any remaining piece. Should a shaman be captured and the player has several pieces that remain to be dropped, the opponent has no way of knowing which piece has actually been captured. The two bishops must be dropped on different colours.

After having jumped any piece, the Basilisk cannon can slide and capture like a queen. However, if no jump move exists it's allowable to slide like a queen, but without capturing.","Enemy pawns, however, can restrict its movement. The Basilisk can only reach the square immediately behind the enemy pawn, regardless of direction. By example, if the black king is checked on the g-file, it can defend itself by moving the pawn forward. While its tactical capacity is truncated the Basilisk can harmonize with the positional qualities of the game. Positioned two or more steps behind a friendly pawn, it can threaten an enemy Basilisk, which cannot threaten back. This is an important positional aspect. The Basilisk has about the same value as bishop + pawn (preliminary estimate).","Before starting, the players must decide whether they want to use the extra piece. To make a decision, press on the little black square. Only if both players choose not to use the extra piece, then it becomes a regular game of chess. If white turns down the extra piece, then black can overrule this.","If players have elected to include external pieces, they may either move a piece or pawn, or drop the extra piece from the reserve. Pieces may only be dropped on the first rank, on an empty square behind a friendly pawn. The friendly pawn is immediately relocated one square ahead, to a position which must be empty. If these conditions aren't satisfied then the piece cannot be dropped. Should a player refrain from inserting his extra piece at these occasions, then he has forfeited his chance of introducing it. Note that pieces and pawns are allowed to move before the extra piece has been dropped.

Instead the Belfry, when it moves, has the power to sling a piece located behind itself to a forward square in the alignment direction. The slung piece, which can be of any colour, is the nearest piece in the opposite direction of the move. This piece is hurled to the square immediately forward of the square on which the Belfry stops. Any enemy piece positioned here is captured. Thus the Belfry can be used for transporting friendly pieces, attacking enemy pieces, or removing enemy pieces from good positions. In opening and middlegame the Belfry introduces new tactical themes. If it remains on the first rank it can transport the rooks and the king very effectively along the first rank. In the endgame it can transport friendly pawns and the friendly king over the board. It can open files for the rooks, by removing a friendly pawn sideways. Pawns can be catapulted to their promotion square, when they are promoted to queen as only alternative. Pawns cannot be catapulted to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit. Kings and rooks retain their castle rights if catapulted away and back, while they haven't moved by their own accord.

M K Morrison invented Big Battle in 1994. The game was-fined                 to its final form in 1998. The first years of its creation involved                 play testing against International Chess Master Ortvin Sarapu (twenty                 time New Zealand Chess Champion). The final rule change came at                 the suggestion of the then New Zealand Champion Alexei Kulashko.                 Big Battle used Chess as a starting point but it becomes a different                 game. Chess players, even children, have found Big Battle an easy                 game to pick up.               Description              Big Battle                 is played on a 10 by 10 chequer board of a hundred squares. Because                 of the enhanced size of the Big Battle Board, the Big Battle counterpart                 of the Chess Pawn, called a Soldier ( Sol for short) has                 the option of moving three squares, two squares or one square forward.                 Unlike the Chess pawn the Big Battle Soldier has these options not                 only on its first move but throughout the game. The en-passant rules                 of Big Battle allow capture by en-passant whenever an enemy Soldier                 on an adjacent file attempts to sneak past by moving two or three                 squares.  The other big difference seen in Big Battle consists                 of a new and powerful piece called the Prince. The Prince                 combines the power of the Chess Knight and the Big Battle Queen.                 But the Big Battle Queen itself has greater powers than the                 Chess Queen. In addition to the traditional powers of the Chess                 Queen the Big Battle Queen can jump over an immediately adjacent                 piece (but cannot move like a Knight). The Big Battle King                 has the ability to move two squares. He also, can jump over an immediately                 adjacent piece. The Big Battle Knight has the option, while                 positioned on its back rank of making a double Knight move, known                 as the double Knight hop, providing that no piece occupies the intermediate                 square of this manoeuvre. The Big Battle Bishop moves exactly                 the same way as the Chess Bishop. Off course the enhanced Big Battle                 chequer board gives it more squares to move to. All Big Battle pieces,                 except for the Bishop, have greater powers than the corresponding                 traditional Chess piece.

The gold fleet consists of one large flagship and twelve escort ships. The objective is to evade capture while breaking through the blockade to transport the flagship to the perimeter of the board. The other player has a silver fleet of twenty ships, and forms a blockade to trap the gold flagship with the objective of capturing it.","Players move alternately by making two moves or one displacement capture. When the flagship is moved, only one move or capture is made. A player may move two of the smaller ships any number of vacant squares, either horizontally or vertically (as a rook in chess, but without capture). The flagship moves and captures like the other ships. However, if the flagship is moved, the gold player may not move another piece.","Capture is performed by displacement, by moving one square diagonally. If the flagship reaches one of the outermost squares on the board, gold player wins. If the flagship is captured, silver player wins. Silver must try and surround Gold, minimizing his freedom of movement. Thus, Silver should avoid exchanging too many pieces, as this creates open corridors for the Flagship to elope. Gold, on the other hand, should strive to exchange pieces.","Breakthru was designed by Alex Randolph and commercially released by 3M Company in 1965, as part of the 3M bookshelf game series. Breakthru has much in common with the Tafl games of the Middle Ages, such as Hnefatafl or Alea Evangelii, as there are unevenly matched teams with different objectives (cf. Wikipedia).

Bughouse has four players playing in turn on two chess boards simultaneously, generally working together as two teams against each other. Pieces captured by a player are passed on to his team partner, who can then drop these captured pieces on an unoccupied square on his board in lieu of a normal move (just as in the two-player game Crazyhouse). Note that pawns may not be placed on the first and last rank, and promoted pawns revert back to pawns when captured. To drop a piece, just click on a captured piece stored outside the boards. A player (or a team) wins by capturing one of the opponents' kings.  Bughouse Chess is a quick and exciting game, especially when played with human opponents and partners. It is especially popular on internet chess servers like www.freechess.org. It is normally played with chess clocks over the board or on the internet. Each player usually has three or five minutes of time, sometimes using time to `sit' while waiting for their partner to capture pieces that they need. This Zillions implementation is a turn based variant of bughouse for both two players and four players, with the following variations:  Variant 1: Single Move Order1. Board 1: (white) played by BluePlayer2. Board 2: (white) played by OrangePartner3. Board 2: (black) played by BluePartner4.

It is a descendant of Indian Chaturanga and is believed to be quite old. The pieces are red and black and are usually carved. The red pawns are carved as demonic men, the black as monkeys, in reference to the battle of the demons versus the god RÃ£ma and Hanuman's monkeys.","The objective is checkmate. The king, rook (chariot), and knight (horse), move as in orthodox chess. The pawns also move as in orthodox chess, but have no initial double move. The General (equivalent: queen) moves one step diagonally in all directions. The Elephant (equivalent: bishop) moves one step diagonally in all directions, or one step forwards. Pawns promote to General only, and only if the General is missing from the board. Pawn promotion occurs only on the marked squares on the enemy side of the board. Promotion occurs not immediately, but when the pawn leaves the square. Note! When leaving the square, a pawn is not allowed to promote if that implies capturing an enemy King or General. A pawn can also promote on the spot, that is, promote without moving (just lift and drop the pawn). It is possible for a pawn to move past the squares where he can promote: in that case, promotion is no longer possible for that pawn.","In the first phase the pieces are dropped on the board, either behind the pawn chain, or on a friendly pawn. In the latter case the removed friendly pawn must immediately be relocated to another empty position. This implementation honours the rule that the rooks must be dropped on the first rank, which is reserved for the rooks only. After all the pieces have been dropped the play begins. Stalemate is not allowed in Burmese Chess. Should you put the opponent in a stalemate position, you must take the move back.","Don't underestimate the curiously moving Elephant, although it is slow. It is very suitable for giving mate. Together with a king, or some other piece, it can often give mate in the endgame. Knights and bishops can seldom achieve this. The Elephant has about the same value as a knight. Passed pawns are much less dangerous in Burmese Chess than in orthodox chess. Play aggressively with the General, because when it is exchanged, you can promote a pawn a get a new one.","The additional drop variants differ only regarding the promotion rules. Pawns can promote upon entering a marked square. The 8 standard positions given as variants derive from the Burmese Chess Guide 'Myan-ma sit bayin lan-nyunt sa-ok gyi', as cited in D.B. Pritchard's The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants.","Note!

Thus, if the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. If the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour. Note that black begins by making the initial swap. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then has the option to relocate his king or queen, whereupon he starts the game by making the first move. Each player can choose between 12 different setups, which results in 144 different board positions.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules are simple and derive from Chess960. King and rook end up on their usual squares. The only difference is that the king can make longer (or shorter, or none at all) leaps than usual. All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened and neither of the pieces must have moved before. Castle on the queenside is denoted O-O-O. Castle on the kingside is denoted O-O.","Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or i), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.

(Although, it may run on version 1.0, which I have not been able to test.)","Castle Siege Chess merges three 20-space circular bands (similar to those used in Byzantine Chess) with a 6x6 rectangular area of spaces into the middle of the inner ring of spaces. This board, dubbed the CirSquare 96, provides 3 directions of attack (frontal and two sides) on the opponents castle. The 96 squares are exactly 50% more than traditional chess and there are 50% more pieces--4 more pawns, 2 Archers, and 2 Catapults. The are 4 rows of spaces (12 spaces wide) between the two opponents' castles.","The standard chess pieces move the same as they do in traditional chess. The Archer and Catapult have very simple moves. The Archer compliments the Bishop and Knight, and the Catapult compliments the Rook and the Knight.","Archer - moves 1, 2, or 3 spaces across corners. It can jump over 1 or 2 pieces across corners. It only captures on the second space.","Catapult - moves 1, 2, or 3 spaces across sides. It can jump over 1 or 2 pieces across sides.

If you want you can even use these in place of Zillions' default set for other Chess games.","The premise                 behind Cavalier Chess is that most pieces have horses, and the game                 represents a cavalry battle between two feudal kingdoms. Cavalier                 Chess uses different pieces than Chess, but each piece starts off                 in the same place as its counterpart in Chess. In Cavalier Chess,                 the Knight King (K+N) replaces the King, the Marshall (R+N) replaces                 the Rook, the Paladin (B+N) replaces the Bishop, the Nightrider                 (multiple N moves) replaces the Knight, and the Cavalier (XiangQi                 N) replaces the Pawn. The Queen is the same as in Chess. Unlike                 standard Chess, there is no castling. When a Cavalier reaches the                 eighth rank, it promotes to the piece whose starting square it lands                 on. A Cavalier cannot promote to a Knight King, and if it lands                 on the Knight King's starting square, it promotes to another superior                 piece of the player's choosing.

The idea of this variant is to make a new game without directly disposing the large heritage of the classical game. All rules of orthodox chess are kept. The way the pieces are placed in the opening setup allows the players to follow practical all the openings used for usual chess. The new pieces (Cannon, Elephant) are inspired from Xiangqi (Chinese Chess), with the intention to bring back together the two branches of the game that went from India and Persia either east to China, and west to the Arabs and then to Europe. Shako is presented in the French book \"Guide des Echecs exotiques et insolites\". Invented in 1990. The name Shako means Chess in Esperanto,'another kind of non-conformism and utopia'.","Tamerlane 2000 Played over a 11x11 board with 56 pieces. This game is a variant of Timur's Chess (or Tamerlane Chess). Victory is obtained when opposite King is checkmated with no more possibility of replacement by a Prince. With this implementation, the game is won when the enemy King is checkmated. This is the first chessvariant invented by Jean-Louis Cazaux. Based on Tamerlane II, a game invented in 1978, revised several times and renamed Tamerlane 2000 to mark the difference. A variant proposed here is Wild Tamerlane played with strong pieces (Queens, Gryphons) since the beginning of the game.","Perfect 12 Played over a 12x12 board with 72 pieces. For the Ancients, 12 was a perfect number. Much more than 10, since it can be divided by 2, 3 and 4. This game is a chess variant on a 12 x 12 board with 12 types of different pieces. A tentative to a well balanced game since there is the same number of Pawns than other pieces. The driving idea was to gather characters from most famous chess variations, historic and regional. Along the traditional Chess pieces, it has the Cannon from Xiang-Qi, the Lion from Chu Shogi, the Camel from Tamerlane Chess, the Gryphon from Spanish Grande Acedrex and the Prince from Courier Chess. The Elephant is a modern variation of medieval Alfil, also found in Shako. There are as many riders (Queen, Rook, Bishop and Gryphon) than leapers (Knight, Camel, Elephant and Lion). The piece density is 0.5 as for FIDE chess.","Gigachess Played over a 14x14 board with 96 pieces. This game is a very large chess variant on a 14 x 14 board with 20 types of different pieces coming from several famous chess variants. The piece density is almost 0.5 as for FIDE chess. This game is so far the biggest of the family. Amazon is the strongest piece, followed by the Queen then the Gryphon. Corporals are stronger than Pawns. Other popular games are given here and can be played using the same graphics.","Deciomega Deciomega Chess is a variant of Omega Chess. It is played on a regular 10x10 board. The two new piece types, Champion and Wizard, are both able to jump. Usual chess rules apply. Proposed (1999) by Jean-Louis Cazaux from Omega Chess. The same file allows to play the genuine Omega Chess invented by Daniel C. Macdonald.","Decimal Oriental Chess Invented by Vernon Rylands Parton, 1897-1974, a very active Chess variant inventor (Alice Chess, Rettah Chess, etc.). Parton included this variant in his booklet 100 Squares Chess + Damante published in 1972. For the game of Decimal Oriental the player has an army of twenty men which consist of two Chariots, two Cannons, two Horsemen, two Camels and two Elephants, with the Minister and Prince Commander, supported by eight soldiers.","Wildebeest Chess In his very nice book New Rules for Classic Games, R. Wayne Schmittberger gives the rules and backgrounds of his large chess variant Wildebeest Chess. One of the design purposes of this variant was to balance the number of riders (pieces like Rook and Bishop) and leapers (pieces like the Knight). e-mail: jl.cazaux@netcourrier.com web page (another view on Chess) : http://www.chez.com/cazaux/"],"image":"game157_scr_Shako.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":10}

It looks like standard Chess, with the following modifications:","4 more squares linked to the 4 corner squares (idea taken from \"Omega Chess\"), these squares takes the coordinates as their ranks and files were present and contiguous: z0, i0 for white; z9, i9 for black. These added squares modify drammatically the standard finals theory and minimum material needed for mating. i.e = Lonely Rook now is not sufficient if the opposite king safely reaches corner squares; in the contrary two knights, now taking advantages of corner squares, can force mate !","2 more pieces: The Prince: Moves like a king. Can cover up to 8 squares and it's valued 3 pawns. Its power is maximum when used in defensive tasks particularly for protecting its own king. In the downside, its slow moving and quite far position at the start force it to move outside later. Like all the standard pieces except for the Knights, Prince must wait the development of the nearby Rook (usually by castling) before going into action. In a second variant called \"Flanking Bishops\" it can develop easily.  The Master: Combines the moves of knight and a king. Can cover up to 20 squares, and great range of forks as it's still a leaper. Excellent for both attack and defense, this piece (valued about 7 pawns) stands in power between the Queen and the Rook; but it's actually the best piece can be promoted to, by a pawn. In the middle game his power equals even the Queen. In a second variant called \"Flanking Bishops\" can be rapidly developed. The new setup has been created looking at innovative \"Omega Chess\", in particular the 4 corner squares that give the possibility to insert 2 new pieces for each side leaving the same armony in disposition of the chessboard. The main difference is the chessboard itself that is always 8x8, this to get easier for new people to play inside their own standard chessboards."],"image":"game169_scr_Chess68.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":2}

I found designing this 32-cell variant very challenging, but also rewarding.  I was able to adapt some pieces from FIDE chess to the geometry of the soccer ball (namely the Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn), and also invented a few new pieces specifically for this game (namely the Wizard, Satellite, Ringmaster, and Guard, along with the \"hidden\" and \"royal\" versions of those pieces).  I borrowed some ideas from Hexagonal Chess, Circular Chess, and even Klinzha to create this game.","In the initial setup, all of the pieces have Pawns or Guards on top of them.  The Pawns or Guards must move off before the pieces can move. You can do that by clicking on the cell where you want the Pawn or Guard to move.  You *cannot* move a piece until the Pawn or Guard on top of it has moved off first.","One challenge was to represent the three-dimensional soccer ball on a two-dimensional surface.  Borrowing a line from cartography, I settled on an AZIMUTHAL PROJECTION centred on a \"pole\", with distortion of distances further from the pole.  In simple terms, this meant centring the ball on Pentagon A, cutting it open, flattening it out, and expanding all the cells around A.  It's not very cosmetic, but it does the trick.  If anybody with better graphic skills than mine wishes to improve the look of the board, please do so!","The King begins the game off-board.  The first move of the game is to \"crown\" on of your other pieces, making it royal.  In the Zillions of Games implementation, do that by clicking on the King (who occupies a dummy-cell off-board) and moving it on top of the piece of your choice.","PIECES","Brief descriptions of each piece follow.  The \"Images\" folder bundled with the ZIP file includes graphics demonstrating the movements.","KING - this piece is inspired by the Goal in Klinzha.  The King, who begins the game off- board, has no movement powers of his own (except on the first move of the game) and must be carried by another piece.  The first move of the game is, therefore, to move the King on top of the piece that will carry him.  The Zillions version treats the King and the piece carrying him as a single piece.  The ROYAL ROOK, ROYAL BISHOP, ROYAL KNIGHT, ROYAL RINGMASTER, ROYAL SATELLITE, and ROYAL WIZARD are the resulting pieces.  Each royal piece retains the movement capabilities of its simple form, but may not move into or through check.","ROOK - rides any number of cell along a straight path between two pentagons.","BISHOP - rides in diagonal loops - defined as hexagonal cells connected by a line between two other cells.  Players of many hexagonal chess variants will recognize this piece.","WIZARD - rides in pentagonal loops - defined as pentagonal cells connected by a line between two hexagonal cells.  The Wizard moves on pentagons much as the Bishop does on hexagons, and was inspired by the hexagonal bishop.","KNIGHT - leaps (a) from one hexagon to another hexagon three cells away, (b) from a hexagon to a pentagon three cells away, or (c) from a pentagon to a hexagon three cells away.","RINGMASTER - rides in hexagonal loops around a single pentagon.  As each hexagon is adjacent to three pentagons, a Ringmaster may move in any one of three directions.","SATELLITE - rides in crooked hexagonal loops around \"equators\", i.e., paths that divide the board equally in two.  Each \"equator\" consists of ten hexagons and has five hexagons and six pentagons on either side of it.","PAWN - moves one cell without capturing on hexagons, or captures by moving one cell from a hexagon to a pentagon, on which it morphs into a Guard.  The Pawn, unlike its FIDE counterpart, may move backward or sideways as well as forwards. At the beginning of the game, every Pawn stands on top of another piece and must move off before that piece can move.  The Pawn may not attack a royal piece (i.e., a piece carrying the King).","GUARD - moves one cell without capturing on pentagons, or captures by moving one cell from a pentagon to a hexagon, on which it morphs into a Guard.   At the beginning of the game, the Guard stands on top of the Wizard, and must move off before the Wizard can move.  The Guard may not attack a royal piece (i.e., a piece carrying the King).","HIDDEN PIECES - pieces with Pawns or Guards on top of them, and are paralyzer until the Pawn or Guard moves off.  NOTE : if you are playing Zillions, the yellow and red pieces in the initial setup are really white and black pieces, respectively, with Pawns or Guards on them.  When the Pawn or Guard moves off, the piece left behind will change colour.","ROYAL PIECES - ordinary pieces that are carrying a King.  In Zillions, when the King mounts a piece, a crown appears above it.","HOW TO PLAY","The game begins by moving the King on top of the piece that will carry him.  Any piece in the initial setup may be chosen.","Next, start moving Pawns and Guards off pieces.  In the Zillions implementation, you will get an error message if you try to move a piece with a Pawn or Guard on top of it - \"Sorry, that piece cannot move now.\"  Choose a piece, and click your mouse on the cell where you want the Pawn or Guard to move.  It will move off, leaving the piece behind - which will change colour (yellow to white, red to black).","Pawns and Guards *may not* give check to a royal piece.  You may well ask why not.  When play-testing with Zillions of Games, I found that every game seemed to be like \"fool's mate\" in FIDE - every game lasted a mere 3-5 moves, with White winning every time.  Frankly, I don't find \"fool's mate\" much fun - I like games to last a little while.  I found the pawns were responsible for most of the premature checkmates, so I disabled their ability to attack royal pieces.","In the CHIVALROUS version, a royal piece may not attack another royal piece.  In the default version, however, it may.","The game is won by checkmate, stalemate, or baring the enemy King."],"image":"game1679_scr_Chess_on_a_Soccer_Ball.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[32,12],"variations":2}

Independently of this priority setting most games are decided by a rainbow condition. The drawing quota in \"Chess on the Rainbows\" is extremely low.  After some piece exchanges it really becomes difficult to keep all colors 'occupied'. So, if you can sacrifice a minor piece for three pawns you typically should try it, because 'three pieces less' means that the opponent will have increased problems to find occupants for all the board colors.

The method generates 9 different positions, all non-mirrored (except the standard position). The players in turn swap either the king or queen. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. The king can only swap with the queen bishop and the queen can only swap with the king bishop.","Black begins by swapping either his king or queen. Alternatively he can forgo this possibility (by pressing the king). When White has made his king or queen swap (or dispensed with this possibility) he immediately starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules are simple and derive from Chess960. King and rook end up on their usual squares. The only difference is that the king can make longer leaps than usual (or shorter, or none at all). All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened. NOTE! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c-file), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","With these relocation rules the rooks remain in their natural positions, and the bishops are always positioned so that there is still a choice to develop them on either of the kingside or queenside. The knights are ready to immediately attack in the centre. This maintains the strategical ambiguity of the initial position. Non-mirrored positions ensure that there exists a strategical tension, which makes games interesting. Black relocates first. White should command the game, and in this way he can take command of the strategical situation. Remember that the resultant castling positions are always the same as in standard chess.","Chess-9 (also Nonary Chess) is designed to overcome the problem of opening monotony. The mirrored Chess960 (FRC) positions have one major drawback, namely that they tend to be lacking in strategical variety, and many times it can be hard for White to claim the initiative, strategically or tactically. It is easier to find strategically interesting positions if we go outside FRC and investigate non-mirrored positions. If we keep the criterion that the king must be placed between the rooks, then Chess960 castling rules can be retained. For instance, if the kings are initially placed on different wings, then there is already a strategical tension (even though the king can castle on both wings). The good thing is that pieces end up on non-mirrored natural positions, bishops can be developed to either wing, the knights can immediately attack in the centre, and the king is placed between the rooks. Balanced non-mirrored positions might actually be a better idea than mirrored ones.","This method of regroupment in the initial array can be used instead of randomization (cmp. Fischer Random Chess). Thus it answers to the chessplayer's predilection for remaining in control.

Like checkers, both sides begin play with 12 pieces situated on the 12 dark squares closest to them; only the dark squares are used for play; and black moves first.  Like chess the pieces capture by occupying the enemy's square rather than by jumping and the game is won by checkmating the opposing King.","Other than being confined to the dark squares all pieces (not pawns) move the same as in chess: Bishops move any number of squares diagonally; Rooks move any number of squares vertically or horizontally to another dark square; the Queen combines the abilities of the Rook and Bishop; the King can move to any adjacent dark square or castle with the Rook. As in checkers the Pawns move only diagonally forward and promote on the back rank but, as in chess, they may promote to any piece other than a King. When castling the King moves one dark square towards the Rook and the Rook leaps to the square the King left.","Since Rooks have no method of moving diagonally they are confined to only half of the dark squares.  To make this easier to visualize Chessers uses a special double-checker board which makes half of the dark squares blue and the other half green.  If this is found to be annoying, distracting or otherwise unhelpful it may be removed in the future.","Chessers includes a second piece set which uses checkers pieces for the King and Pawns which may be preferable for 'Pawns Only' and 'Pure' variants.","This game is young and may see minor changes in the future.","Game and rules file are Copyright 2002 Harvey Patterson.

It has been reinvented many times, and Ralph Betza is responsible for naming it Chessgi. It is basically Chess with the addition of drops from Shogi. Whenever you capture a piece, you replace it with the same piece of your own color, and you hold it in hand with the option to drop it on a subsequent turn. If you have any pieces in hand, you may use your turn to drop a piece on an empty square. This counts as your full turn. You may not move a piece and drop a piece on the same turn. Any Pawn on the second rank has the option of a double move. Although Chessgi is intended as a hybrid of Chess and Shogi, the rules of Chessgi differ from Shogi in some notable respects. Promoted pieces remain promoted when captured. They do not demote back to Pawns. Pawn drops are less restricted than in Shogi. Pawns may be dropped on any empty square except those on the last rank, and a dropped Pawn is allowed to checkmate.  The same ZRF includes the game Shatranji, invented by myself, which is a hybrid of Shatranj and Shogi. Shatranj is an early Chess variant that is included in the Zillions Fairy Chess ZRF. Shatranji is just like Chessgi except for being based on Shatranj rather than Chess. I invented the game, because a Shogi-like game may work better with weaker pieces, and some of the pieces in Shatranj are weaker than their counterparts in Chess.  The image below is from a Chessgi game I won against Zillions. The ZRF gives you the option of four different piece sets. These include the abstract set pictured with Mortal Chessgi, the magnetic set I included with Magnetic Chess, the motif set pictured with Crazyhouse, and the default Zillions set. Only the abstract set includes specially designed pieces for Shatranji.

In addition to checkmate, a side can also win by capturing the opposing king's scepter. Black's scepter is in the palace on f8,f7,or g7 and white's scepter on f1,f2,or g2. Only the king can capture a scepter, so for example,if the white king marches towards the black king's palace, black can use this opportunity to checkmate, or drive the white king away and march the black king towards the opposing palace. Pawns promote on the last rank to Queen-guard, ninja-guard,flying bomber or knight. The unused squares do not hinder the movement of any pieces. All rules governing draws including stalemate are exactly as in orthodox chess","The Ninja Guard's Moves ------------------------ The Ninja Guard is a color bound piece that can move one or two steps diagonally. It can leap over a diagonally adjacent friendly piece to land exactly 2 squares away (a two-space diagonal leap). It can capture on any square it lands, and additionally it can can capture an enemy piece that is diagonally adjacent by jumping over it. It can capture two pieces (the first immediately adjacent to it, and the next right after) in its path on a diagonal by jumping over the first one and capturing the second piece on the square it lands.","The Ninja Warrior's Moves -------------------------- The Ninja Warrior can move one or two steps orthoganally. It can leap over a friendly piece to land exactly 2 squares away (a two-space orthogonal leap). It can capture on any square it lands, and additionally it can can capture a piece right next to it by jumping over it. It can capture two pieces (the first immediately adjacent to it, and the next right after) in its orthogonal path by jumping over the first one and capturing the second piece on the square it lands.","The Extra-mobile sliding pawn ------------------------------ The pawn moves and captures exactly as in orthodox chess except for the following. Normally, when a pawn faces an opposing pawn or an enemy piece, the pawn is blocked. However, the sliding pawn can, under these circumstances only if it is blocked, slide pass the enemy piece or pawn with the same 1-step diagonal movement that it would make when capturing.","The Queen Guard ---------------- The Queen Guard moves exactly like the King, 1 step orthogonally or diagonally. Ironically, the Queen-Guard despite appearing to be less powerful than the flying bomber, can deliver mate with the help of a king.","The Flying Bomber's Moves -------------------------- The flying bomber's odd combination of long-range and short-range moves makes it a deadly weapon against an unsuspecting opponent.","Standard Move:","The flying bomber eliminates an enemy piece by flying over it, and landing on THE empty square immediately after it on the same orthogonal line. It cannot fly over or capture a second piece or land on any square beyond the first empty square.","The flying bomber can fly along any amount of empty squares (1-9) orthogonally, but not over any friendly pieces. This is identical to the movement of a rook.","For a successful bombing, there must be an empty square immediately after the first enemy piece on the same line.","Special Move: the Helicopter Landing","This is a special maneuver that enables the flying bomber to fly over the adjacent square, (jumping over, if occupied by friendly piece or eliminating if occupied by enemy piece) and land like a helicopter on a square exactly 2 squares away, capturing if possible on this square.

But it cannot capture in this way. In order to capture it makes an orthogonal `cannon` capture-jump. It jumps over any piece and lands, like a cannonball, on the enemy piece farther back, provided that any intermediate squares are empty. Its value corresponds to a knight or bishop. The other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Columbiad. The camelrider moves gives it a good mobility in congested middlegame positions. As it combines mobility with the power of the cannon capture, it is ideal for king-attacks in the middlegame. As it can only capture as a cannon, and not as a knight, this piece is easier to control. The unusual H-shaped board makes it possible to introduce this piece without giving it undue advantage in the opening, thus avoiding monotonous opening strategies. The Columbiad is dangerous in the middlegame, but is perhaps weaker in the endgame, while screens for jumping become fewer.

The players in turn swap, firstly, the king, secondly, the queen. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then has the option to relocate his king. After the kings thus have been swapped the turn goes back to black. The queens can now optionally be relocated. When white has made his queen swap (or dispensed with this possibility) he immediately starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules derive from Fischer Random Chess. White castles in the following way (the Black procedure is equivalent). When castling left (O-O-O) , the king moves to c1 and the rook moves to d1. When castling right (O-O) the king moves to g1 and the rook moves to f1. The following conditions must be true: the king must not move to, from or over an attacked square; the king and rook have never moved; there is no other piece on any square over which the king and rook move. Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","Curtailed castling: as an alternative rule, the king may retain its castling right only if it is placed on any of the four central files. In other words, if the king is positioned on the g or b file, the castling right is forfeited. After all, such a safety move brings certain advantages so it should cost something.

Troyka","description":["Connected Chess follows the rules of standard chess, with one exception: After each turn all isolated pieces (i.e., pieces not adjacent to any piece of either color) are removed from the board.  In the variant, pieces that are not adjacent to any friendly piece are removed after each turn.  Connected Chess requires careful development of your forces. Pieces typically must work in concert to advance across the board. In the principal game you can move a piece to a space adjacent to an enemy piece, but you should be careful when doing so because the opponent can remove your piece by isolating it. In the variant, you can capture an enemy piece by capturing its only adjacent friend, in which case you get two (or more) captures with a single move. In both the principal game and the variant it is possible to capture up to five enemy pieces in a single move. It is also possible for a piece (not the King) to commit suicide by moving to an isolated space.  Checkmate can be unusual. In the principal game, if the opponent King is adjacent to a friend in an otherwise empty portion of the board, you can checkmate the King by capturing the adjacent piece. In this situation, the King has no available move because reciprocal capture or moving away to an unattacked space would leave the King isolated, which is illegal. This situation is a checkmate, as opposed to a stalemate, so long as the initial capturing piece can capture the King on the next move either by direct capture or by withdrawal to a space beyond the King's reach.  In the illustration below, White has checkmated the Black King. The King is in check because the Rook can capture it through isolation simply by moving away. Black cannot remove the King from check because capturing the Rook would leave the Knight free to isolate the King, and because all other adjacent spaces are attacked.  It is possible for one King to capture the other. A King can move to a space adjacent to the enemy King as long as the enemy King is unable to attack it as a result of the isolation rule. If the moving King is in a position to move away from the enemy King on the next move, and there is no other piece that the enemy King can approach, checkmate will result. If the moving King is not in a position to remove itself from the enemy King, a strange diad may occur: The two Kings must remain adjacent to one another and yet are forbidden from capture by the isolation rule. An example of a game ending in diad can be found in the saved game called \"Diad\" included in the folder.  In the variant, you can checkmate the opponent King by attacking the only piece adjacent to it. If the opponent cannot remove the adjacent piece from attack in a way that keeps it adjacent to the King, or move the King to a space adjacent to\\another friendy piece, the King will be checkmated.  The board may be switched with the standard Zillions chess board by selecting \"Switch Piece Set\" from the \"View\" menu.

In Bughouse, four people, divided into two teams, play two Chess games. Members of the same team play different games, with one playing Black and one playing White. Whenever a player captures a piece, he gives it to his teammate, who may hold it in hand and drop it into his own game on a subsequent turn. In Crazyhouse, a player gives captured pieces to himself, changing their color, so that they now belong to his side. This makes Crazyhouse a bit less crazy than Bughouse. Crazyhouse is very similar to Chessgi, whose origins are in Shogi rather than Bughouse, but a couple of the rules are different. In Crazyhouse, Pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank, and promoted Pawns turn back into Pawns when they are captured.  The ZRF gives you the option of four different piece sets.

The rooks are replaced by Crooks (Cannon-Rooks). This magic piece can change movement capability by using up a move to transform itself. A Crook rook can change into a Crook cannon by turning the rook upside down, or vice versa. The Crook cannon uses Chinese Cannon movement: it moves as a rook or jumps a piece to capture. It is somewhat weaker than a knight, but its tactical capability is great. In any case, the Crook cannon can always transform itself back into a Crook rook, which is the same as a normal rook. Note! After the piece is transformed it must make a move before making yet another transformation. Thus, it's not possible to stay put and make continual transformations on the same square. The Crook has great attacking potential and is easier to maneuvre than the clumsy rook. It is more valuable than a rook, but it costs time to transform back and forth between its cannon and rook guises.","There is also a variant with an \"improved pawn,\" which has an additional movement direction.

Both these titles are offshots of conversion chess. Conversion chess is a type of chess where pieces via capture, and/or position in relation to other pieces, switch sides. The bulk of the game's code, with minor tweaks, comes from W.D Troyka's Benedict Chess. The game has the same variants as found in Benedict chess.   Object:The object of this game is to convert your opponent's king to your color.   Gameplay:Standard chess rules apply, except:  There is no capturing.  At the end of a move, all enemy pieces attacked by the moving piece (under normal chess rules) are flipped to become friendly pieces.  You win by flipping your opponent's King.  In the variant, a promoted piece does not flip opponent pieces on the same turn as the promotion.  Desert Benedict Chess is a wild game of rapidly shifting alliances. Unlike Benedict Chess, however, the line of play tends to be a bit more stable, as it requires pieces to be adjacent to Because there is no capturing, the full complement of 32 pieces remains on the board at all time, and the game is strictly positional.  As with Benedict Chess, flipping the opponent's array pawns is not as advantageous as may first appear. Because they cannot capture, flipped pawns can serve as shields preventing (only for a moment) flipping of the opponent's royal pieces. The end result can be certain bottlenecks on certain parts of the board.   Designer Notes: I had an idea in the back of my head one day to do a hybrid between Chess and Attaxx/Spot (aka, Blobs in Zillions). To do this, I took the basic chess set and had the idea of where moving next to an enemy piece would cause capture. The end result is Desert Benedict which is what I had in mind. It is a game that borrows elements from both. It has the converting of pieces of a player by being next to them from Desert Chess, while not having capture from Benedict. Thus, the game \"Benedict Chess\" got its name. I do want to thank W.D Troyka for letting me use the base code for this variant. Due to this, I was able to get this game done fairly quickly."],"image":"game281_scr_DesertBenedictChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":2}

Historical examples are Sparta, and the Roman Republic during the 'duumvirate'. The game is played on the Gustavian board, invented by King Gustav III of Sweden (cf. Gustav III's Chess).","The enemy Witch has the friendly pieces and pawns under a spell, making them incapable of attacking the enemy Kings. However, the bewitchment does not affect the friendly Witch and Kings. The only way that the spell can be broken is for the friendly Witch to sacrifice herself. Thus, when either of the Witches disappears, the spell is broken for all the pieces on the board. When so happens, the red indicator changes to green. The Witch moves like a Rook and can make one step on the diagonal. The Princess moves like a Bishop and can make one step on the orthogonal. The Kings cannot castle. The Pawn promotes to Queen and other pieces, but not to Witch. The goal is checkmate.","Since Kings are immune against attack from the enemy pieces, except the Witch, they become powerful attacking pieces. It is necessary to take advantage of this opportunity, already early in the game. It creates a very unusual situation on the chess board. However, one must be prepared for the eventuality that the enemy Witch sacrifices herself, in which case the King becomes vulnerable to the enemy pieces.

Positioned next to the majesty it can move like a Dromedary (Camel), namely leap three squares in a straight line, and one to the side (3+1). So now any piece can go to the kingly stable, mount a Dromedary, and ride away.","The Dromedary, under the name of Camel, is a piece that dates back at least to Tamerlane Chess, allegedly invented by Timur Lenk. The Camel is used in many modern chess variants, but it seldom appears to its advantage since its long leaps makes it somewhat awkward to handle. Another factor is that it is colour-bound and can only reach half of the positions on the board. In this variant the Dromedary capabilities are utilized in a different way. It does not appear as a physical piece. Instead, any piece can, as it were, mount a Dromedary, and make a long leap. Pieces that fulfil the requirements for making a Dromedary leap are referred to as dromedaries, e.g., \"a bishop-dromedary on f1\".","This variant is interesting because there is an inherent conflict between protecting the King, and, on the other hand, to keep the King near the battle situation, while it can increase the strength of the friendly pieces, which can then attack by Dromedary jumps. Probably one should keep the King in the center for a while, and not castle too soon. Already in the middle game, a daring player might advance with the King, in order to provide his army with Dromedary reinforcement.","The endurance and strength of the dromedary (Arabian camel) have made it a valuable beast of burden. The dromedary, generally used as a saddle animal, can cover more than 161 km (100 mi) in a day. It is also an effective battle animal.","There is also a variant where Scorpions take the place of the pawns. The Scorpion has the additional moves of a Knight, but only in two forward directions: east-north-east, and west-north-west. There are no additional capture moves.The Scorpion's value is half the value of a Knight or Bishop, that is, 1.5. This means that a light piece can be exchanged for two Scorpions, a possibility which often occurs. In the endgame it could become very dangerous, and its value often increases.","Dromedary Chess can also be played by email at Chessvariants.org."],"image":"game1252_scr_DromedaryChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":3}

The                 pieces one can use (drop) is determined by the Drop Chess variant                 you choose to play. For example, when you play a 'Flag'-side (like                 Black in the diagram below) you have 1 Flag (d8), 1 Queen (f8),                 2 Archbishops (b8,g8), 2 Topguards (d5,g7), 1 Tower (e8) and 1 Rook                 (a8) to be dropped initially on the first rank. There's no constraint                 regarding the position where a piece can be dropped, so there are                 a lot of possible set-ups.

The object of the game is to checkmate or stalemate the enemy King; converting the King (see below) also counts as a win.","Pieces - except Pawns and the King - are grouped into two 'families'. The line pieces (Rook, Ringmaster, Warlord, and Spire) form one such family; the leapers (Knight, Archer, Airman, and Sailor) form another.  When a piece lands on top of another piece in the same family (either friend or foe), it assimilates its powers.  Pieces may not assimilate pieces from a different family.  A Rook-Spire combination is therefore possible, but a Rook-Knight combination is not. A Rook landing on top of a Knight simply captures it as in traditional chess, and removes it from the board.","The leaping pieces may also capture by leaping over an enemy piece.  This converts it to a friendly piece.  A leaper may, in fact, capture two pieces at once: if there are two adjacent enemy pieces, a leaper may jump over the first and land on the second.  The first is converted to a friendly piece; the second is either assimilated (if a fellow-leaper) or removed from the board (if a non-leaper).","Pawns and Guards capture by acting as pincers.  If a piece has an enemy Pawn (or Guard) both before it and after it, it is converted to the enemy player'rmf.

A condition is that the pawn is blocked by an enemy pawn. Compared with standard chess, this means that a flank pawn is sometimes endowed with an extra jump move, which increases its value only slightly. Hence the flanks cannot easily be blocked, something which greatly enhances attacking play.","There are three different variants of dynamic pawns. The pawn is endowed with the extra jump move to an empty square (1) if blocked anywhere on the file (2) if blocked on the 4th rank onwards (3) if blocked on the enemy side. Note that the opponent can prevent this jump move by occupying the square, so it is not always easy to achieve.","In Dynamic Chess (Chess4) black can decide the initial positions of the queens. (If black so chooses, the piece array remains unchanged.) The positions must mirror each other. Dynamic Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the queen and a light piece. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour. Note that black begins by swapping his queen. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is. The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the queens thus have been swapped the turn is still with white.

Instead the Echidna has the power to repulse any piece (friend or foe, including pawns) that is being approached, provided that any intervening squares are empty. The piece is repulsed to the square immediately beyond the next piece, thus causing the startled piece to jump beyond a screen in sheer fright. An enemy piece positioned here would be captured. If there is no screen, or the square behind the screen is occupied by a friendly piece, then no repulsion occurs. In case of an enemy pawn, it cannot be pushed back to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit. The enemy pawn can be pushed to its promotion square, whereby it is promoted to a queen, as only option. A friendly pawn, pushed to the last rank, can promote as usual. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Echidna. The Echidna's value is 3, that is, the same as a bishop or knight (preliminary estimate). Despite its low value the Echidna has capacities that borders on the magical.","Echidna Chess can also be played with Kwaggas instead of knights. The Kwagga moves like an extended knight, three squares orthogonally plus one step to the side. It can multiply this jump in the same direction. This means that the Kwagga moves like a Camelrider. However, unlike the Camelrider, the Kwagga can only capture on the first jump, and the next square must be empty.

But when I settled on the name of Eurasian Chess, the idea took on a life of its own. I conceived of the game as a synthesis of some of the main European and Asian forms of Chess, predominantly FIDE Chess and Chinese Chess. But I also based it on Grand Chess, created by Dutch game inventor Christian Freeling, and on the other five main regional variants from Asia, which are Shogi (Japan), Janggi (Korea), Makruk (Thailand), Sittuyin (Burma), and Shatar (Mongolia). Eurasian Chess includes all the pieces from Chess, except that it gives the King some properties of its counterpart in Chinese Chess. It includes the Cannon from Chinese Chess, and it includes the Vao, which Englishman T. R. Dawson created as the diagonal counterpart to the Cannon, which is to the Cannon as the Bishop is to the Rook. Although it contains fewer pieces from Chinese Chess than from Chess, it is still a fair balance between European and Asian variants, given that some of the other main regional variants in Asia are more like European Chess. In fact, of all the pieces in Eurasian Chess, the Queen is the only piece that is common to European variants but not found in any of the main Asian regional variants. Half of the pieces in Eurasian Chess are Chaturanga pieces shared by both FIDE Chess and between three and six of the six main regional variants in Asia. The eight-directional leaping Knight and the divergent Pawn are used in three Asian variants, the eight-directional King in five Asian variants, and the Rook in all six main Asian variants. The additional pieces are the Queen, which comes from Europe; the Cannon, which comes from China; the Bishop, which was created in both Europe and Japan; and the Vao, which is of mixed heritage, because it was created by a European who based it on the Chinese Cannon.  A full description of this game can be found at: http://www.chessvariants.com/large.dir/eurasian.html  The artwork for the game combines characteristics of both European and Chinese sets. The board is checkered like a European board, but by using a floor tile technique, it has tiles intersecting in the middle of each space, so that pieces are also placed on points, as they are in Chinese Chess. The piece set displayed here uses disks for pieces, as is done in China, but uses western images. The western images are colored black and white, as European pieces normally are, but the disks are colored blue and red, which are commonly used for pieces in Chinese Chess. Besides the set shown here, the ZRF uses piece sets I have previously included with YÃ¡ng QÃ­ and Chinese Chess.

Any empty square on the first rank can serve as initial square, creating great opening flexibility without departing from standard opening strategy. The horses can be introduced via any empty square on the first rank and move immediately, effectively a double-move. Pieces can be introduced at any time, provided that a move exists that originates from the first rank. For instance, if the red elephant has already moved away, a horse can be introduced via c1, thus reaching the square d3, for instance (provided that it is empty). Another way of formulating the rule is that the horses are potentially present on the empty first rank squares. Flexible Chinese Chess is intended as an alternative to standard Chinese Chess, radically increasing the ramification of openings. By waiting a few moves before introducing an external piece, a player can hide his intentions.","Chinese Chess rules","The objective in Chinese Chess is to checkmate the opponent's General. It's also a win to stalemate your opponent so that he can't move - this usually only happens when a player is reduced to a lone king. A player may not force a repetition of moves. The horizontal space across the center of the board is the river separating the territories of the two sides. Elephants are not allowed to cross the river, whereas Soldiers promote once they cross it. The 3x3 box marked with an \"X\" is the General's imperial palace or fortress. Each General and his Mandarins may not leave their fortress. There are seven pieces in Chinese Chess:","Soldier/Pawn (zu/tsut, bing/ping = foot soldier) Soldiers can move forward until they cross the center section of the board (called \"crossing the river\") where they gain the ability to move left and right. The Soldiers are initially positioned on the 4th and 7th rank.","Horse/Knight (ma = horse) Horses move like a Knight in Chess, except that they can't jump over other pieces. They step outward on a row or column, then diagonally outward one step. If something is adjacent to a Horse on a row or column, it can't move in that direction. The Horses are initially positioned on the 2nd and 8th file.","Elephant (xiang/tseung = elephant; xiang/sheung = minister/premier) Elephants move diagonally two steps. However, Elephants cannot jump over other pieces, so an Elephant is blocked in any direction where another piece is diagonally next to it. Elephants are defensive pieces: they must stay on their side of the board and cannot cross the 'river.' The Elephant is similar (but without the ability to leap) to the Alfil in Shatranj, the precursor to the modern Bishop. The Elephants are initially positioned on the 3rd and 7th file.","Chariot/Rook (ju/kui = chariot) Chariots move like the Rook in Western Chess, that is, any number of squares along a row or column. The Chariots are initially positioned in the corners.","Cannon (pao = cannon) Cannons move like Chariots/Rooks, by sliding any number of squares along a row or column, but they can capture an enemy only if there is another piece (of either side) in between. Thus to capture they leap over the intervening piece and land on the enemy piece, like a cannonball. One account of Xiangqi dates the introduction of the cannon at 839 A.D. The Cannons are initially positioned on the 3rd and 8th rank.","Mandarin (shi/see = counsellor) The Mandarin must stay confined to the fortress, and can only move a single step along the diagonal lines shown. This gives it only 5 possible positions. This piece is often translated into other names such as Assistant, Guard, Counsellor, and Officer. The Mandarins are placed beside the General.","General/King (jiang/cheung = general, shuai/sui = general) The General is confined to the fortress and can only move a step at a time horizontally or vertically. It also has the special power to threaten an enemy General across the board along an open column. For this reason, it is not permitted to make a move that leaves the two Generals facing each other with nothing in between. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's General. The General is positioned in the middle."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":2}

The positions must mirror each other. Future Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the king + queen and another piece. The king may not swap with any of the rooks. The queen can be swapped with one of the rooks provided that the king remains between the rooks (this is a requirement of Chess960).","Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the kings thus have been swapped the turn is still with white. White can now relocate the queen, if he so wishes, and black then mirrors this. Next white starts the game by making the first move. Diagrams of the 25 possible setups can be viewed here.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. Castling rules derive from Chess960 but have been extended. King and rook end up on their usual squares, but the king also has the option to jump one square farther toward the corner (so that it ends up on the b- or h-file). All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened.","Note! If the King starts the game on a castling destination square (b, c, g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook.","The curious but useful board was invented by king Gustav III of Sweden (see Gustav III's Chess). The extra corner squares (citadels) are also known from medieval big board variants, such as Citadel Chess (14th century?). The board sizes were either 10x10 or 12x12 and had four extra protruding squares that served as sanctuaries for the king. (cf. Pritchard: The Classified Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, p.244). The extended castling rule makes play on the wings easier to achieve. The king can rapidly take control over the kingside or queenside corner square."],"image":"game1859_scr_FutureChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":5}

Several elements are based upon games presented within Zork Grand Inquisitor[ZGI] and Return to Zork[RTZ].","THE PLAYING FIELD","The playing field, which was in ZGI with only Pawns and no rules [the solution was to hit it with a plank, breaking it], consists of three seperate circle patterns.  They are basicly 8x8 fields with the outer cells and the second corner cells cut off.  Or a 6x6 field with its corner cells removed.","Each field will be considered connected to the others in a circular manner, meaning that the first is below the second which is below the third which in turn is below the first.  The c2 cell of one field is orthogonal to the c2 cell of the other two.  This makes the b2, c1, c3 and d2 cells of the other fields diagonal to that same c2 cell.  And b1, b3, d1 and d3 of the other fields are triagonal to that c2 cell.","THE PIECES","DUNGEON MASTER leaps to any vacant cell on any field, leaving a Hole behind which no piece may land on.  Does not capture any piece, can only be captured by Grue.  A player may also rotate the level that this piece occupies 1/4 of a turn as a move if the opposing DM is not present on that level.  Represented by an `X`.","GRUE moves orthogonally, may leap over any number of occupied cells or Holes, excluding those which are occupied by Fire of either player.  Must end its move on the first vacant cell.  Can capture Water or Dungeon Master.  If there is a vacant cell directly between it and another Grue, regardless of owner, a new Grue may be spawned as a move.  If the Grue performs a capture, it may make another move including spawning another Grue.  Represented by a question mark because none who have seen a Grue have survived, and those who perished by a Grue rarely actually saw it coming.","WATER spawns more Water in any one adjacent diagonal cell.  Can only capture Fire.  Represented by three wavy lines.","FIRE spawns more Fire in any one adjacent triagonal cell.  Can only capture Grue. Represented by an open triagonal.","Grue, Fire and Water will move to and from each field according to their particular move restriction.  Note that Fire is only able to move by changing fields.  Spawning moves are accomplished by simply tounching the piece to spawn and releasing it.","The Dungeon Master is an amalgamation of two pieces within the game of Survivor located in RTZ.  The pieces of Grue, Fire and Water were based upon elements within a form of Rock-Paper-Scissors located in ZGI.","THE SETUP","Each field is initially occupied by one type of piece of each player, either Grue, Fire or Water.  The players choose which field will hold these pieces in turns.  Four of the same will be placed in the first rank of four cells on any one side of a field, with the other player placing on the four far cells directly across.","It is not necessary that each player place the same piece as the opponent on the same field.  Nor is it necessary to place pieces on the same side of the field on each level.","Then each player will place their Dungeon Master in turn on any vacant cell of any field.  And the game commences.","Just touch the cell where you want your Dungeon Master to move, and like magic, it will move there.  To rotate a field, simply touch the desired directional arrow below it.  Be sure that SMART MOVES is activated in OPTIONS located in the VIEW section.","The game is won by either capturing the opposing Dungeon Master, stalemating the opponent, or capturing all opposing Fire, Grue and Water."],"image":"game1085_scr_GUE3DChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[32,12,27],"variations":0}

The Kampas can only enter if the centre is already occupied by a Gala, or by an enemy Kampa. Kampa ('warrior') initially moves one step diagonally towards the centre. After being promoted the Kampa can move and capture one step in all directions. But the Kampa is not allowed to enter the inner part of the friendly castles, because this area is reserved for the higher classes. Two variants of Gala have been implemented. They differ only in Kampa promotion: (1) promotion occurs after the first move (2) promotion occurs after passing the line to the cross (second game variant: \"weak Kampas\"). In variant (1), should the Kampa return to any of the initial squares of the friendly Kampas, its movement capability is again restricted to the initial movement.  In variant (2), should it return to any of the friendly castles its movement capability is again restricted to the initial movement  (excepting the square diagonally adjacent to the centre). When passing the line, inwards or outwards, the Kampa cannot capture.  Korna ('berserk warrior')  moves orthogonally outside the cross. Moves diagonally inside. Can make an additional move after crossing the line. If the Korna crosses the line with the first square he moves, he can move, in addition, any number of free squares diagonally. Otherwise, when crossing the line, his additional move is only one square diagonally. If you don't want to make the additional move, you must press the pass button. If capture occurs when crossing the line, there is no additional move.","Horsa ('horseman', or 'mounted warrior') moves diagonally outside the cross. Moves orthogonally inside. Can make an additional move after crossing the line. If the Horsa crosses the line with the first square he moves, he may move, in addition, any number of free squares orthogonally. Otherwise, when crossing the line, his optional additional move is only one square orthogonally. If capture occurs when crossing the line, there is no additional move. Note! In its first move the Horsa can only move one step.","Note: when crossing the line inwards, the Horsa is not allowed to capture an adjacent piece to the sides (i.e. any piece which is positioned alongside the line which is passed over). The Horsa (the mounted lancer), when jumping over the mound, needs space to be able to turn his horse, catch up speed, and continue the attack. There is an additional variant (\"strong Horsas\"), where the Horsa is still allowed to capture a piece to the side if it's aligned with the movement direction. In both cases the Horsa can capture an adjacent piece which is orthogonally \"forward\".","Gala ('king') can move a single step in any direction. The Gala loses the ability to capture when positioned inside the centre. (There is also a variant, \"weak Galas\", where the Gala is not allowed to capture when entering the centre.)

Instead the Gastrophete, when it moves, has the power to sling a piece located immediately behind itself to a forward square in the alignment direction. The slung piece, which can be of any colour, is the adjacent piece in the opposite direction of the move. This piece is hurled to the square immediately forward of the square on which the Gastrophete stops. Any enemy piece positioned here is captured. Thus the Gastrophete can be used for transporting friendly pieces, attacking enemy pieces, or removing enemy pieces from good positions. In opening and middlegame the Gastrophete introduces new tactical themes. If it remains on the first rank it can transport the rooks and the king very effectively along the first rank. In the endgame it can transport friendly pawns and the friendly king over the board. It can open files for the rooks, by removing a friendly pawn sideways. Enemy pieces can be kidnapped and subsequently attacked. Pawns can be catapulted to their promotion square, when they are promoted to queen as only alternative. Pawns cannot be catapulted to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit. Kings and rooks retain their castle rights if catapulted away and back, while they haven't moved by their own accord. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Gastrophete. The Gastrophete's value is the same as a bishop (preliminary estimate).

Pieces move as in orthodox chess. The pawns also move as in orthodox chess, but have no initial double move. As the pawns are all located on the third rank, they can reach the fourth rank immediately anyway. Castling doesn't exist. In the first phase the players take turns to drop pieces on the board (two moves per turn), either behind the pawn chain, or on a friendly pawn. In the latter case the removed friendly pawn must immediately be relocated to another empty position, that is, somewhere on the second rank. The rooks must only be dropped on the first rank. The two bishops must be dropped on different colours. After all the pieces have been dropped the play begins.","Geminus Chess is a double-move variant. The double-move, after the dropping phase, is constituted by a pawn move followed by a piece move, which is mandatory. There exist two variants of Geminus Chess. In one variant pawn moves are compelled, until there exist no more pawn moves, when the pieces can continue moving without being preceded by a pawn move. Should a pawn become free to move again, it is compelled to move. In the other variant the player may abstain from the pawn move, and instead move a piece, but then he has lost his double-move.","Note that a player, when the king is threatened, can make a pawn move before taking measures to protect the king.

It captures on the second leg only. The Gladiatrix can also move by colliding against the margin, whereby only one movement direction is available after collision. Without screens to collide against the Gladiatrix cannot move. The Gladiatrix's value is 6, which corresponds to rook + pawn (preliminary estimate). Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Gladiatrix. The Gladiatrix is the most powerful of the bifurcation pieces. It is, arguably, the most agile among all the known pieces. It has the capacity of zigzaging between the pieces and find its way in quite congested situations. As it moves by coordinating with other pieces, the Gladiatrix is a highly cooperative piece. The structure on the board decides its possibilities. Although screens for colliding become fewer, the Gladiatrix does not loose power in the endgame. But, unlike the rook, the Gladiatrix cannot, together with the king, give mate to the enemy king. The unusual H-board makes it possible to introduce the Gladiatrix while allowing it a proper amount of movement freedom in the opening. Note that, on the knight-files, the Gladiatrix can also collide orthogonally with the margin and continue to the extra corner square.","Gladiatrix Chess can also be played with Kwaggas instead of knights. The Kwagga moves like an extended knight, three squares orthogonally plus one step to the side. It can multiply this jump in the same direction. This means that the Kwagga moves like a Camelrider. However, unlike the Camelrider, the Kwagga can only capture on the first jump, and the next square must be empty. The Kwagga is as valuable as a bishop (my estimate).

The squares of the board are colored to make it easier to see the moves and ranges of the various jumping riders.

After having jumped any piece, the Swedish cannon can slide and capture like a rook. However, if no jump move exists it's allowable to slide like a rook, but without capturing. The Swedish Cannon has about the same value as a bishop (preliminary estimate). Pawns can, additionally, promote to Cannon.","The Swedish Cannon can take active part early in the game, so one ought to introduce it early. The Cannon can be exchanged for a light piece that has acquired a good position, or it can threaten an enemy rook on an half-open file. The Swedish Cannon is stronger than both its counterparts, the Korean Cannon and Chinese Cannon, making it easier to introduce it in a context of Western pieces. Its movement is similar to the Korean Cannon, but the Korean Cannon is stranded when no jump moves are available. This cannot befall the Swedish Cannon while it is then, and only then, allowed to slide like a rook, but without capture.","Fianchetto can be a good idea in that it gives better protection against the enemy Cannons. Interestingly, if the enemy Cannon has no jumps, then one can sometimes position a piece so as to provide a jumping option, thus preventing the Cannon from using his right to move like a rook.","The closest relative of the Swedish Cannon is the Korean Cannon. The Swedish Cannon also appears in Swedish Cannon Chess, and in Alternative Chess. The board was invented by king Gustav III of Sweden for his own chess variant.","In another variant the Crab pawn is introduced. The Crab moves like a pawn, but if its northward movement is blocked it has two extra moves: two forward knight jumps to empty squares only (east-north-east and west-north-west). Note! It cannot capture this way.

Thus to capture it leaps over the intervening piece and lands on the enemy piece, like a cannonball. If positioned on a white square it jumps like a Nightrider, that is, can make continuous knight jumps in the same direction, provided that the interim squares are empty. Otherwise, the rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible pawn promotion to Cannonrider. The Cannonrider's value is 5, that is, the same as a Rook.

Chess for example","is an evident and living portrait of the medieval Christian world, with its","representative board of a small kingdom and with pieces that represent the most","important figures of the feudal war.","The idea arose in these authors of inventing a board game with elements of the","culture of Rapa Nui. In a game of this type the board would represent the island,","the pieces the figures of the Rapa Nui culture, and the sense and objective of the","play some fictitious, historic or mythological event related to them.","Thus was born `Hanga Roa`. We conceive it to be like a fight or competition among 2","coalitions of Rapa Nui tribes. Each one of these coalitions fights by displacing in","the quickest possible way a Moais in a road of stone, since it is its goal to reach","to the opposite side of the island. The Mato-to'a or warlike are the pieces","responsible for destroying these roads and for impeding the movement of the enemy","Moais. The Ariki, or tribal chief, is a piece that has the power of building the","stone roads. Another form of victory is reached if one of the coalitions surrounds","and knocks down the Moais of its adversary.","Although only time will determine the degree of success of this game, we believe","that an objective already has been completed, to honor the value and ingenuity of","the people of Rapa Nui.","Objective:  The winner of `Hanga Roa` is the first player that manage to","carry his Moais to the last square of the enemy field or to capture the adversary","Moais.  Each side has one Moai to carry, three Arikis, and three Mato-to'as.","Moai The Moai is the main piece of the game.  It lacks its own","movement and can only move to squares in which stones of its color exist,","which are retired when the Moais occupies them.  During a turn the Moai can","displace as many stones of its color as there are in its way, provided that","they are connected.

However, in order to \"fold its wings\" and become a normal Harpy pawn again the player must use up a move on the spot. In the flying state the piece cannot interact with other pieces, that is, cannot make captures. You transform a pawn (either Harpy to Flying Harpy or the reverse) by simply pressing on the piece.

Any  piece of either color on the bottom square is removed from play.   Win by checkmating the King in either Heaven or Hell.   Repetition is a loss.","Play in Heaven is fundamentally altered by the damnation rule.  Sacrificing pieces is often advantageous because it  increases the strength of your forces in Hell.  The interplay  between the two boards requires delicate balancing.  The moves  that improve your position on one board can weaken your position  on the other.  Players commonly will be winning on one board and  losing on the other.  The game then becomes a race to see which  player can accomplish checkmate on the respective boards faster.","The game gives rise to interesting tactical situations.  A piece  in Heaven is impervious to capture if it would check the enemy  King from the same position in Hell.  A King that is directly  above an opponent King can never be in check.  A King in Hell  cannot move to a space beneath an attacked friendly piece.   Sacrifices that would be unthinkable in regular chess (e.g.,  a Queen for a Pawn early in the game) are common.","In variant II, the players begin with a full complement of pieces  on both boards.

Updated May 10, 2003: several mods by L. Lynn Smith. Rabbit Elimination and Immobilization wins added by Tim O'Lena, June 2020. Translated into the Hexagonal Domain June 2020 by Tim O'Lena.","See the 'Learn to Play' section on www.arimaa.com for an animated tutorial.","Objective There are three ways to win a game of Arimaa. The first player to get just one Rabbit across the board to a goal cell wins. On this Hexagonal board, Gold's goals are the 11 hexes spanning a6-f11-k6; Silver's goals span a1-f1-k1. Another way to win is to eliminate all of the opponent's Rabbits. In standard Arimaa, you win if you capture the opponent's last Rabbit, even if you sacrifice your own last Rabbit to do so. The third way to win is by immobilizing your opponent. Stalemate is a LOSS for the immobilized side.","Setup The game has no fixed starting position for the pieces.  The game starts","with an empty board.  First Gold sets down all Gold pieces, in any order, based on the diamond configuration of the McCooey Hexagonal Chess set-up (White side).  Silver then sets up all the Silver pieces,  based on the diamond configuration of the McCooey Hexagonal Chess set-up (Black side). Once the peices have been set down the players take turns moving the pieces with Gold going first. Each player has 7 Rabbits, 3 Cats, 2 Dogs, 2 Horses, 1 Camel and 1 Elephant. It is common to guard the traps with Cats in standard Arimaa. Since each side has three traps in Hexagonal Arimaa, it may be convenient to have three cats to match.","Steps In each turn the players can take up to 4 steps. All pieces move the same way, which","is laterally (i.e. left, right, forward and back). Except that Rabbits cannot move","backwards.  Moving a piece from its current square to an adjacent square counts","as one step.  The 4 steps can be distributed across multiple pieces.  Thus a player","can move one piece 4 steps, four pieces 1 step each,one piece 3 steps and another","piece 1 step,  etc. The same piece may take steps in different directions. A player must change the configuration of the board on every turn - it is illegal to cancel your own moves out, resulting in no change to the position. The position must be different at the end of a players turn. You may pass up to three of your four moves if you like.","Pushing and Pulling A piece can push opponents weaker pieces to any laterally adjacent square and","move into its place. This is called 'pushing' and uses up 2 steps; one for","pushing the opponents piece and one for moving into its square. Pushing must","be completed within a players turn and cannot be distributed across turns.  The Elephant is the strongest and can push any other piece except another Elephant. The Elephant is followed in strength by the Camel, then the Horse, Dog, Cat and","finally the Rabbit which is the weakest and cannot push any other piece.  Pieces","of equal strength cannot push each other. A piece can also pull opponents adjacent weaker pieces","into the square that it moved from.  This is called 'pulling' and uses up","2 steps; one for moving the piece and one for pulling the opponents piece. A piece cannot simultaneously push and pull. You may push or pull only one opposing piece at a time. But it is possible and legal to push and/or pull twice in the same turn, using the four available steps.","Example: Gold's Elephant on b1 moves to c1, pulling a Silver cat from a1 to b1. That uses two steps. In the next two steps, Gold moves the Elephant from c1 to c2, pushing a Rabbit from c2 to c3. In this example, Gold could also have chosen to pull the Cat twice, with the Cat ending on c1.","Freezing A piece that is alone and adjacent to an opponents stronger piece is","considered 'frozen' and cannot move. A piece is considered to be alone if","there are no friendly pieces laterally adjacent to it. The lonely weaker piece","can be 'unfrozen' by moving any other friendly piece next to it. When no longer","alone the weaker piece is unfrozen and can immediately begin to move within","the same turn.","Traps The positions at c3, c6, f3, f9, i3 and i6 are called 'traps'. Any piece that is standing","on a trap is immediately removed from the board if there are no friendly pieces","adjacent to it. A piece may safely stand on or pass through a trap as long as there is","a friendly piece adjacent to it. If the friendly piece moves away then the lonely","piece on the trap is immediately removed from the board.","Notes about the Zillions implementation * To pass the move, click on the 'change turns' button. * Use the 'Variety' slider under Play > Computer Opponent to get Zillions of Games to create varied starting set-ups."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

All rules are adapted to the new board shape as closely as possible. The major change from a square-shaped to a hex-shaped board involves the  number of squares which are considered adjacent to another square. On the  normal chess board, a square usually has 8 neighbours. On the hex-board,  a square (or better, a hex) has 12 neigbours: There are now 6 'orthogonal'  and 6 'diagonal' directions, as opposed to 4 each. Consequently, 3 different colours are used to make orientation easier, so  when moving in an 'orthogonal' direction, the hex colour changes with every  step. When moving 'diagonally', it stays the same. A side effect of this point  of view is that 'diagonally' moving pieces appear to 'jump' hexes, which is  not really true: The Knight remains the only jumping piece.","This hex-transition by Dave McCooey is one of the more logical ones. Most  chess rules remained, and everything works as one would expect it. The rule changes in detail: 1. There is no castling. 2. The centre Pawn may not double-step. (The second change was made in order to disallow White to seize the centre  with her first move.)","Due to the increased mobility of pieces, the material that can force checkmate  in the endgame has also changed. Among other observations, Mr McCooey found out  that two Knights can now force checkmate against the lone King.

{"zrfID":1359,"id":"hiashatar","name":"Hiashatar ","programmerID":380,"programmer":"Mats Winther","created":"2006-11-18","description":["Hiashatar is a medieval chess variant deriving from Mongolia. The pieces move as in orthodox chess, with the exception of the additional piece, the Bodyguard (also called 'Senior Adviser' or 'Warrior'). It slides one or two steps in any direction. The Bodyguard has about the same value as a rook + two pawns (my estimate). A Bodyguard cannot checkmate (or capture) the enemy king. The Bodyguard can stymie the movement of enemy pieces, except the horse. This implies that an enemy piece can only move one square at at time so long its movement occurs on the squares immediately surrounding the Bodyguard. The horse, being so important in Mongolian life, is not affected by the stymieing powers of the Bodyguard. The pawns move as in orthodox chess, inclusive of the initial double-step and 'en passant'. The pawn can also make an initial triplicate step, which means that 'en passant' can also be performed when the enemy pawn stops on the rank behind the friendly pawn. Pawns promote only to queen. Castling does not exist. The positions of white king and queen are interchanged (compared with standard chess). In Hiashatar, the restrictions for checkmating, which are characteristic of Shatar (8x8 Mongol Chess), are absent.","Thanks to its stymieing capability the Bodyguard is immune against long-range attacks from enemy queen, rook, and bishop. This also means that these pieces cannot easily guard friendly pieces being threatened by an enemy Bodyguard. This makes the Bodyguard a very useful attacking piece in the middlegame. If the Bodyguard is placed centrally during the middlegame, it effectively stymies the long-range enemy pieces. The horse, however, remains a serious threat to the Bodyguard. The Bodyguard's inability to threaten the enemy king is a serious deficit. There is no castling in Hiashatar, and removing the king from its exposed position in the centre is not always necessary, thanks to the effective protective capability of the Bodyguard. In an additional variant the Bodyguard stymies also friendly pieces, and can capture only the nearest square. This is possibly an authentic historical variant.","The word 'Hiashatar' means 'Bodyguard Chess' (Shatranj). This game is still played in Mongolia, although Fide-chess is taking over more and more. Hiashatar is said to have appeared 500 years ago.","References","http://www.geocities.com/kisslook/eng/mongeng.html  http://history.chess.free.fr/hiashatar.htm"],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,34],"variations":2}

Each player has a single piece called the Monarch that can move to any square on the board that can be reached by a combination of orthogonal moves.  The move must end by pushing or pulling a Soldier in a straight line any number of vacant spaces.  Soldiers are neutral pieces that cannot move on their own.  Win by capturing the opposing Monarch or crushing it so that it cannot move.","The Monarchs are separated by a wall of Soldiers called the Front.  Behind the Front, the area through which the Monarch can move is called its Dominion.  The effect of the Monarch's motion is to push and pull the Front so that it forms an ever changing line separating the players.  Basic strategy consists of forcing the enemy Monarch to breach the Front so that it can be captured on the next turn, or collapsing the Front around the Monarch until it is crushed.","Hobbes is named after Thomas Hobbes, a 17th-century British philosopher who argued that power naturally gravitates to a single absolute Monarch.  The game was invented in 1998 and inspired by Robert Kraus' Neutron.","Hobbes comes with 2-player and 4-player variants played on 5x5, 7x7, and 9x9 boards.  In the 4-player variants the game continues until a single Monarch remains.  Smart Moves must be selected in order to play the 4-player variants. You can design your own variants by right-clicking to place the pieces.","A Monarch move is normally accomplished by first moving the Monarch to a square adjacent to a Soldier, then pushing or pulling the Soldier.  If the Soldier is on the same rank or file as the Monarch, a push may be accomplished in one step.  If a move could be either a maneuver (push or pull) or a Dominion move to be followed by a maneuver, Zillions will offer you a selection box.","Hobbes was conceived as a 5x5 game and is most entertaining at that size.

It is the exact inverse of the Battle Templar. It can capture by replacement only on the square it lands.  The Ferz-Knight - moves like a knight or makes one step diagonally. The Wazir-Knight - moves like a knight or makes one step orthogonally.","The Mutating Serpent is a piece that can transform itself into various piece types: the Flying Bomber, the Raptor, the Cannon, the Vao, the Stealth Gryphon, the Anti-Gryphon, the Ferz Sorcerer","and the Wazir Conjurer.","It can be dropped in an empty space on the two outer squares only.","Dropping it constitute a turn. The piece can only be moved on the next turn.","Transforming into another piece also takes a turn.","The mutating serpent must be dropped as one of its mutating forms, and it can mutate only after making at least one move during its current mutation. Thus, if dropped as a raptor it can only be transformed into a Flying Bomber any turn after making a move as a Raptor.","The serpent mutations: (see piece help for more detailed info)","Flying Bomber moves like a rook and captures by flying over enemy. It also makes a special capture by replacement 2 squares away. It can also jump over an adjacent friendly piece.  The raptor is the diagonal version of the Flying Bomber.   The Cannon is the same piece as in Chinese chess.  The Vao is the diagonal equivalent of cannon.  The Stealth Gryphon slides to squares along an unobstructed path of one diagonal square followed by two or more orthogonal squares outwards.  The Stealth Anti-Gryphon - Slides along unobstructed path of one orthogonal square followed by two or more diagonal outwards.  The Ferz Sorcerer jumps an extended leap like a zebra or steps one diagonally. The Wazir Conjurer jumps an extended leap like a camel or steps one orthogonally.","The Ninja Pawns:","This special pawn can move/capture like a regular pawn as well as move 1 space sideways. When in enemy territory it can also capture 1 space sideways. It can move 1-multiple spaces toward the center and en-passant does not apply.","Up to 4 Ninja Pawns can be dropped (1 per turn) to an empty space on the 2nd rank , and you can optionally make the forward thrust in the same move.","See the piece help/description for more info.","Rule Changes:  --------------","Flexible Castling - The king can castle by moving 1 to 4 squares towards rook. The rook always ends up next to the king on the other side as in standard chess. The same rules: cannot castle out of check, king cannot pass over squares attacked by enemy etc apply.  The choice of castling depends on whether it is more desirable to immediately  have the rook in the center file or the king tucked away at the wing.","Note: When carrying out 1 step castling, Zillions pops up a box asking to choose a move.  The second move indicating kings move AND the rook to move to king square is the castling move.","The standard pawn move is modified slightly - it can now move 1,2, or 3 squares initially. It can also move two spaces forward if it moved only 1 space or captured from original position.","En-passant is modified to accommodate this. A pawn that attempts to bypass an enemy pawn by making a double or triple move is captured En-passant.","This En-passant only applied to standard pawns. Ninja pawns cannot capture or be captured this way.","Pawns and ninja pawns promote in the last rank to any piece.","For full details see:","http://chess.computerwebservices.net/holy.php","*** Instructions for Dropping Ninja Pawns / and Mutating Serpent  **** -----------------------------------------------------------------","Clicking on an empty square in 2nd rank will drop a ninja pawn.

In an alternative variant the pawn must reach beyond the fifth rank to get the extra move capability. This will hardly affect opening theory at all. The variant where the pawn must reach beyond the fourth rank could possibly affect some variants, like Modern Benoni.","This method is a surprisingly simple way of introducing extra complexity. The technical and theoretical nature of today's computerized chess, calls for a change toward higher complexity. Comparatively, in orthodox chess a pawn is easy to block. This creates the marked drawishness of practical endgames.

The must capture rule, combined with the number of methods of capture, results in a game that plays a bit like Checkers crossed with Ultima.","The goal of Interweave is to capture either of your opponent's two Kings.      Kings move one square diagonally without capture, and capture by a \tshort orthogonal leap. \t Leapers slide diagonally without capturing.  They move orthogonally or \tlike Nightriders without capturing to any square of the same color \tthey start on, or moving the same, they may leap over and capture one \topposing piece on the other color, landing on empty square past of the \tcolor they started on. \t Removers may slide diagonally without capturing, or capture any \torthogonally adjacent opposing piece without moving. \t Smashers slide diagonally without capturing.  They move orthogonally \tany distance, only stopping on squares of the same color they started \ton.  If there is an opposing piece on the next square, it is captured. \t Pawns move one square diagonally without capturing, two squares on \ttheir first move.

The original Zillions version simply had different set-ups as  variants.  In this version, players drop their Horse and Elephant pieces in the  formation of their choosing prior to play.  I have tried to make this easier for  players by having Zillions automatically dropping Elephants besides their  Horses, so that you only have to drop two pieces (Horses) instead of four (both  horses and both Elephants).","This version of Janggi includes a script for running one of four different  Janggi scripts, namely:  Small board and pieces , in color   Large board and pieces   Black \u0026 White  Set, intended mostly copying games from Korean books,        should you have any.  To this end, there are 3 boards showing rank and        file labes.  One shows an Algebraic grid, one shows digits and [Chinese]        numerals often found in Korean Janggi books and the last is an all-digit        grid system, as used by the Korean Janggi Association.   Bakbo (mating problem) editor, to create and view your own mating        problems, or games you played and wanted to record a satisfying position,        but did not record the moves prior to this point.   Janggi pieces are octagons, unlike the circular Chinese Chess pieces.  There are  also 3 sizes of pieces, related to their value:  Generals are largest, Rooks,  Cannons, Horses and Elephants are mid-sized and Soldiers (pawns) and Ministers  are the smallest.  The grid of Janggi boards, unlike Chinese Chess boards, are  not formed with sqares, but oblong boxes wider than they are tall.","This version includes the \"Bigjang\" rule of Janggi.  It is similar to the \"No  Bare Kings\" rule of Chinese chess, except that if both players' generals face  each other across the board without intervening pieces, it is a forced draw and  not a win or loss.  Also included are [semi-official] handicap games, as  variants.","One further change in this version is that the Red Player (Han) sets up first  and moves second.  This gives slightly more advantage to the Blue Player (Cho).   This is something I had overlooked in my previous Janggi ZRF modules.","I have included numerous example games (ZSG files) for this script.  There are  several readme files for a full explanation of these game files.  These example  games are sorted into folders:   Korea vs China  (Korean Janggi masters vs Chinese Xiangqi masters)  Openings (example openings in Janggi)  Bakbo (some simple mating problems)  Malcolm Horne (games from Malcolm Horne of the UK)   KyoJin Kim of Korea generously supplied these Example games to me, as well as  some graphics I used and a good deal of clarification on the rules of Janggi.   Mr. Kim is a long time Janggi enthusiast, rated as an amateur 3-dan Janggi  player.

Mr. Kim can be  reached at janggidosa@yahoo.co.kr  if you wish to contact him about Janggi Dosa  and perhaps try to encourage him to create an English version of this fine  program, which he has not done to date due to a lack of interest of this fine  program outside of Korea (to date).","For more information on Janggi, please visit: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Janggi (or send a subscription request to  Janggi-subscribe@yahoogroups.com)"],"image":"game153_scr_Janggi.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,23],"variations":8}

The game represents the traditional war between                 the black race from South and the yellow race from North. The object                 of the game is either to capture the enemy Princess or the Chieftain                 with any piece. Pieces in Jetan move in combinations of directions,                 which means they are free to change their direction during their                 move so long they do not cross the same square twice in a single                 move. Pieces may only capture on their final square.              The                 rules of Jetan were described in the science fiction novel \"The                 Chessmen of Mars\", Vol 5 of the \"Martian Tales\",                 by Edgar Rice Burroughs in 1922. So many wrong rules are given in                 sources, one may wonder: BUT, WHO REALLY READ THAT BOOK? At the                 last page of the book, Burroughs made a summary of the rules. Gollon                 took these rules for his own book (\"Chess Variations Ancient,                 Regional and Modern\") but could have made a few mistakes. One                 was corrupting some piece names. Another was probably a wrong assumption                 on the Thoat move (see variants). Further descriptions, Pritchard                 for example, followed Gollon. The first description given in the                 Chess Variant Pages from Hans Bodlaender on Internet, contained                 many other discrepancies from this genuine rules (Padwar moving                 orthogonally and more).               Here,                 the corrected actual rules are proposed here (well, except the draw-condition).                 Also, the name of the pieces have been restored to the ones given                 by Burroughs: Panthan, not Panthon or Panton; Flier, not Odwar which                 is another piece,..."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":5}

The pieces are initially     forbidden from retreating, forcing the game into an advancing attack.  Upon reaching the far end of the     board, pieces promote with the increased power of being able to move both backwards and forwards.  Captures are      compulsory, enabling players to lay traps for each other by forcing an unfavorable exchange for a favorable one      or a better position.  This game is an attempt to blend these elements in with Chess.                 Of all the family of Chess games,     Shogi is the one that most easily lends itself to this kind of play.  It already has a number of pieces with a forward     orientation and the majority of pieces promote in some way.  Additionally, the compulsory capture rule, where a      piece is sacrificed in order to achieve a strategic advantage, can be seen as an inversion of Shogi's 'in hand' rule,     where a strategic advantage is achieved by obtaining enemy pieces. Not to mention the ancient Japanese code of     Bushido, where it was considered a disgrace to refuse a fight and the greatest honor was to die in the service of one's     lord.                 Ravens, Priests, and Squires are apprentice Chess pieces that move like Rooks, Bishops and Knights respectively,     except they are forbidden from any backwards movement. When they cross the far promotion line they promote and gain their     full abilities to move backwards and forwards.                 Pawns move one space forward and capture diagonally forwards, as in      Western Chess.  When they cross the promotion line, they promote to Gold Generals.                                Captures are compulsory.  A bare King     is also considered a loss.  Promoted pieces are denoted in red.

The pieces have similar names, but their moves differ somewhat from Chinese Chess. The goal is to checkmate the opponent's General. The river is unimportant to the rules, and there is no promotion. Soldiers, Chariots, and Cannons can move along diagonals when in either side's fortress. Players are allowed to interchange a Horse and Elephant if they want before the game commences. It's allowable to pass a move anytime, so stalemate does not exist. To pass a move: lift and drop the General. Korean Chess takes longer to play than Chinese Chess, often 100 moves before a conclusion is reached. On the other hand, it is relatively fast paced.","Korean Chess evolved either from Xiangqi or from a common ancestor. There has not been much written about Korean Chess. The first Korean Chess association was formed in Korea in 1956. Players are ranked using a Dan system similar to the one used for Go.","There are seven pieces in Korean Chess:","Soldier/PawnThe Soldier can move (and capture) forward, left or right.

While inside the opponent's fortress, Chariots can also move along the diagonal lines.","Cannonmoves like Chariots, but can only move by leaping over an intervening piece, called a \"screen\". Cannons may neither capture other Cannons nor use other Cannons as screens. While inside the opponent's fortress, Cannons can also jump along the diagonal lines.","Mandarin/GuardThe Mandarin must stay confined to the fortress, and can only move along the lines.","General/KingThe General must stay confined to the fortress, and can only move along the lines.

I loved Infinite Chess, but thought there was room for improvement in the placing and movement capability of the Pawns.  Because the Infinite Chess game is proprietary, I realized that I would have to change more than just the pawns in order to make what I could present as a game of my own.  Besides the Pawn modifications, I have customized the promotion rules and checkmate rules, added several new pieces, and renumbered the board in a way that is (to me) more user-friendly.","The standard chess pieces are used (1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 8 Pawns), as well as four \"fairy\" pieces : 1 Empress (a Rook-Knight combination), 1 Princess (a Rook-Bishop combination), 1 Crusader (a King-Knight combination), and 1 Crown Prince (moves like a King, but is not royal).  There is also the Steward, which exists only as a promotion piece : on entering the \"enemy zone,\" a Pawn becomes a Steward, which moves passively in any orthogonal direction, and captures in any diagonal direction.","White Pawns move in a Southwest-Northeast or a Northwest-Southeast direction (the latter are shown upside down, for clarity).  Black Pawns similarly move in a Southeast-Northwest or a Northeast-Southwest direction (again, the latter are shown upside down).","The game is won by checkmating or stalemating the opponent.  The King is immobilized when attacked, meaning that a check must be relieved in some other way - either by blocking the line of attack or by capturing the attacker.  I settled on this rule after playtesting with zillions revealed that it is often impossible to force checkmate on a virtually seamless board like this one.  I do not like drawish games, so I decided that some restrictions on the King, without distorting his basic character, would be in order."],"image":"game1784_scr_LemniscateChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":2}

What if in a Chess game all pieces except the King would move and capture in different ways? The three basic pieces, Rook, Bishop and Knight, give rise to six combinations. These consist of a top-piece called the hunter which constitutes the way the piece captures and a bottom-piece called the carrier, which constitutes the way the piece moves. Of course only hunters can give check, therefore a piece is called after its hunter. Also there are piece drops to avoid a drawish system; capture those enemy pieces and have them work for you!","As an afterthought came the concept of Dragonfly, which may be considered as 'normal Loonybird'.","The differences with orthodox Chess:","The nature of the pieces has been explained, but for the option to re-enter them. If a piece is captured, it becomes the captor's property and he may drop it, at the cost of a turn, on any empty square. Until dropped, the captured piece stays put beside the captor's side of the board. As in all systems that feature the re-entering of pieces, this is called a 'piece in hand'.","Pawns are the same as in orthodox Chess, but are not allowed the initial double step. They promote on moving to the far side to a piece the opponent has in hand. Pawns, if captured, are out of the game.","The King is the same as in orthodox Chess. He has a castling option with the rook-Bishop under the usual conditions, moving to b1 with the rook-Bishop having the choice between c1 and d1. Castling with a dropped piece is not allowed. The following applies specifically to the pawns in HexLoonybird:","As in Loonybird, pawns move one cell forward, without the option of an initial double step. Different from Loonybird, pawns do not capture diagonally forward, but obliquely forward to a directly adjacent cell.

Unfortunately, all he knows about cake is what he's seen through his telescope, so he substitutes local ingredients. It looks beautiful, but the Earthman is immediately poisoned upon eating it.","That's the design conceit of this game. What might Chess look like if it were \"re-created\" by someone who's had glance at the game, but never learned the rules and doesn't even quite remember what the pieces look like, or even what size the board is? He knows that the pieces move differently from one another, and one piece is more important, but that's about it. As a result, this game is played on a 6x6 board and the movement of every piece has changed (other than the General, which moves as a King). \"Design conceit\" aside, I wrote the game because I had built a very beautiful 6x6 physical board and pieces, and just wanted something different to play on it. I made the pieces visually unique because playing it with Chess pieces is mildly confusing (though it can be done).","With a smaller board, the pieces engage much more quickly than in Chess, so there is no en-passant. Also, since Officers can step over friendly pieces at any time, there is no castling. And since movement is generally limited to a maximum of two steps, you won't generally find a lot of back-field infiltration in this game. It's very much a field of battle with a definite front, and draws are common. Since the pieces are more similar in strength than in Chess, a game tends to be either cautious dancing or a bloodbath.","As might be expected, this isn't as good as \"Earth cake\" (Chess).

This is modeled after how magnets work,                 with opposite poles attracting and like poles repelling each other.                 With the exception of Kings, when any piece moves, it attracts or                 repels each of its closest rook-wise neighbors. Enemy pieces get                 drawn to adjacent squares, and friendly pieces get pushed out as                 far they can go. This regularly rearranges the board, provides a                 new way to promote Pawns, and creates new kinds of tactics. Joao                 Neto has also created three other variants based on the idea of                 pieces attracting and/or repelling each other. In Anti-Magnetic                 Chess, like attracts like, and opposites repel. In Gravity Chess,                 pieces attract each other, and in Anti-Gravity Chess, pieces repel                 each other. ZRF files for all four games are bundled together in                 one zip file.                 The                 pieces are made from Armando Marroquin's Chess Magnetic font. The                 image below comes from a game in which the computer played Black                 and had a thinking time of only one second. It is White's turn to                 move. Can White keep his King safe by taking the Queen? No. It will                 pull the Knight down, and the Black Knight will then take the White                 King. So you can see that Zillions plays this game very well. You                 should also notice that the position here is actually impossible                 in regular Chess, since some Pawns have been pushed to spaces they                 could not occupy in regular Chess.

Instead the Mangonel, when it moves, has the power to sling a piece located behind itself to a forward square in the alignment direction. The slung piece, which can be of any colour, is the nearest piece in the opposite direction of the move. This piece can hit an enemy piece in the forward direction, provided that any intermediate squares are empty. If there is no enemy piece then the catapulted piece lands on the remotest square in a series of empty spaces. Thus the Mangonel can be used for transporting friendly pieces, attacking enemy pieces, or removing enemy pieces from good positions. This is a new and versatile weapon on the chessboard. Pawns can be catapulted to their promotion square, when they are promoted to queen as only alternative. Pawns cannot be catapulted to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit.

In the latter case the removed friendly pawn must immediately be relocated to the position next to and ahead of the dropped piece. This position must be empty.

Note that pieces and pawns are allowed to move before all pieces have been dropped.","Since the pawns are placed on the board from the start, the dropping phase is shorter than in other drop variants.

All traditional 2D chess rules apply to Millennium 3D Chess including rules for capturing, castling, en passant, declaring a draw, stalemate and checkmate.  A complete set of Millennium 3D Chess rules can be downloaded from: http://webspace.webring.com/people/pm/millennium3dchess/  KNIGHT: The Knight moves in a 'L' shaped manner which can be described as moving two squares along a row and one square along a column, or visa versa. The Knight can also change one level and move two squares, or change two levels and move one square.  BISPHOP: The Bishop moves diagonally as well as along a sloping direction following a diagonal. A 'sloping' move is defined as moving both one square and changing one level -- or -- moving two squares and changing two levels. A Bishop cannot move vertically straight up nor down.  ROOK: The Rook can move along any row or column, and the Rook may also move vertically up or down as well along a sloping direction following any row or column.  QUEEN: The Queen can move along any row or column, move along any diagonal, move vertically up or down, and move along a sloping direction following any column, row or diagonal.  KING: The King can move one square in any direction, change one level, or move one square in any direction and change one level. The King can never be moved into 'check'.  PAWN: A Pawn can move straight ahead one square, change one level up or down, or move both one square forward and change one level. On a Pawn's first move, a Pawn can move two squares straight ahead, change two levels, or move both two squares forward and change two levels in a sloping direction. A Pawn cannot advance directly into an occupied square. A Pawn can only capture an opposing chess piece by moving one square along a forward diagonal or along a forward sloping diagonal. When a Pawn reaches the starting row and level of the opposing King, then the Pawn is immediately promoted to either a Queen, Rook, Bishop or Knight.  The author wishes to thank L.

Then this alone King can be checkmated.","A side effect of this method in the previous version of the zrf was","that the Zillions engine avoided to capture Pre-Kings, because the","uprising King had a tenfold value than the captured Pre-King.","Therefore the value of the Pre-Kings is boosted by a tweaking method","proposed by Keith Carter.","Richard Hutnik beforehand made a ZRF with the easier to implement goal","of capturing both kings. A variant with this goal is included here also.","From the brochure and web-site:","\"Millennium Chess was developed to improve the skills of the average to","excellent chess player.

The object is to checkmate the opponent's General by attacking it so that it has no safe positions to move to. It's also a win to stalemate your opponent so that he can't move -- this usually only happens when a player is reduced to a lone king. A player may not force a repetition of moves. Generals cannot face each other on a file with no intervening pieces. The 3x3 boxes at the top and bottom of the board are the Generals' imperial palaces or fortresses. The Generals may not leave their fortresses. Right-click on the pieces to see how they move. Chariots are the most valuable pieces. The Horse is less valuable than the Cannon in the opening, but becomes stronger as the game progresses. The Cannons are effective positioned behind friendly pawns. MiniXiangqi was introduced by S. Kusumoto, in 1973. There exists a MiniXiangqi federation in Japan. Four game examples are provided.","Endgames properties: A lone General can be mated (remember that checkmate and stalemate both win, and Generals cannot face each other a file with no intervening pieces) by General and Soldier, General and Horse, or General and Chariot.","Soldier/Pawn (zu/tsut, bing/ping = foot soldier)  Soldiers can move forward left and right, immediately from the beginning (unlike in normal Xiangqi).","Horse/Knight (ma = horse) Horses move like a Knight in Chess, except that they can't jump over other pieces. They step outward on a row or column, then diagonally outward one step. If something is adjacent to a Horse on a row or column, it can't move in that direction.","Chariot/Rook (ju/kui = chariot) Chariots move like the Rook in Western Chess, that is, any number of squares along a row or column. The Chariots are initially positioned in the corners.","Cannon (pao = cannon) Cannons move like Chariots/Rooks, by sliding any number of squares along a row or column, but they can capture an enemy only if there is another piece (of either side) in between. Thus to capture they leap over the intervening piece and land on the enemy piece, like a cannonball. One account of Xiangqi dates the introduction of the cannon at 839 A.D.","General/King (jiang/cheung = general, shuai/sui = general) The General is confined to the fortress and can only move a step at a time horizontally or vertically. It also has the special power to threaten an enemy General across the board along an open column. For this reason, it is not permitted to make a move that leaves the two Generals facing each other with nothing in between. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's General. The General is positioned in the middle.","Alternative variants","MiniXiangqi can also be played with promotion. The Soldier promotes, optionally, when moving up to the 6th or 7th rank.","MiniXiangqi can also be played with two Leopards each, positioned at b1/b7, f1/f7, with the Cannons before them at the second rank.

The method generates 57 different positions, all non-mirrored (except the standard position). The players in turn swap, firstly, the king, secondly, the queen. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. Knights and rooks cannot be swapped. The bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen).","Black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can forgo this possibility (by pressing the king). While the turn is still with Black, he now has the option to relocate his queen. White may not relocate his queen so that a mirrored position occurs. When White has made his king + queen swap (or dispensed with this possibility) he immediately starts the game by making the first move. Note that it is possible for the king to swap with the kingside bishop, but this necessitates that the queen be swapped with one of the bishops so that the bishops end up on different colours.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules are simple and derive from Chess960. King and rook end up on their usual squares. The only difference is that the king can make longer leaps than usual (or shorter, or none at all). All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened. Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","With these relocation rules the rooks remain in their natural positions, and the bishops are always positioned so that there is still a choice to develop them on either of the queenside or the kingside. The knights are ready to immediately attack in the centre. This maintains the strategical ambiguity of the initial position. All positions are non-mirrored. This ensures that there exists a strategical tension, which makes games interesting. Black relocates first. White should command the game, and in this way he can take command of the strategical situation. The most conservative relocation, it seems, is to change place between king and queen, which is a convenient way of avoiding theory. Remember that the resultant castling positions are always the same as in standard chess."],"image":"game1807_scr_Multi-chess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":6}

Both the soldiers and the king move one square along the line in any direction. They capture by jumping over a friendly piece, landing on an enemy piece. (It is not allowed to jump over an enemy piece.) Capture is not mandatory. A soldier is prohibited from capturing a king. You win by checkmating or stalemating your opponent's King.","Nam Dinh uses the same board pattern as the medieval European game Alquerque. The source for the game is a Czech book by Zapletal (1991). According to an article in Variant Chess, 61, 2009, Zapletal bases his description on information from someone called Z. Hartmann who had seen the game played by natives of Nam Dinh, a province in the Red River Delta region of northern Vietnam. Accordingly, I have chosen the name Nam Dinh for this game, because I don't know the native name. It has also been denoted Vietnamese Chess, but this is improper since there is really no relation to chess. Vietnamese Chess is actually the name of a Xiangqi variant.","This new implementation of Nam Dinh uses the better understood rules, as clarified by Robert Reid. The earlier rules are based on a misunderstanding. It is said that the soldiers cannot capture. But this renders a game that is boring, since it is all about shuffling pieces. What's worse, it is a win for the first party in two moves: 1.Sd2-c3 Kc5xe3 2.Sd1-d2 checkmate! (Due to the fact that the soldiers cannot capture they are unable to move after black's first move, and the king is forced into a checkmate.)","The correct rule is this: the soldiers cannot capture a king. It seems likely that the two last words have simply been dropped in the faulty rendition. This renders a fine game that demands great skill. It does not appear to be drawish, although non-trivial endgames with 3 versus 3 pieces should be regarded a draw. The privileged king rule also appears in Italian Damone and the SÃ¡mi Dablo games (Dablo Daares, etc.), which have also been implemented in Zillions.","References: Zapletal, MiloÅ¡ (1991).

The game is played on both the outside and inside of a soccer ball, with the 12 pentagons serving as \"gateways\" between the two sides.  Along with the 12 pentagons, there are 40 hexagons - 20 on each side, making 52 cells altogether.","Players of ALICE CHESS with recognize the similarities - it's like having two boards, with pieces able to move from one to the other.","The name and the idea come from C.S. Lewis's novels, \"Chronicles of Narnia\".  Remember the wardrobe?  and the magic picture frame?  These and other \"gateways\" allowed passage from Earth to Narnia.  One could also recall Jack L. Chalker's \"Wellworld\" science-fiction novels : there was a gateway at the pole of many planets, allowing people to travel to the Wellworld.  The pentagons in this game serve a similar purpose.","In the initial setup, all of the pieces have Pawns or Guards on top of them. The Pawns or Guards must move off before the pieces can move. You can do that by clicking on the cell where you want the Pawn or Guard to move. You *cannot* move a piece until the Pawn or Guard on top of it has moved off first.","The King begins the game off-board. The first move of the game is to \"crown\" on of your other pieces, making it royal. In the Zillions of Games implementation, do that by clicking on the King (who occupies a dummy-cell off-board) and moving it on top of the piece of your choice.","PIECES","Brief descriptions of each piece follow. Bundled with the ZIP file are graphics demonstrating the movements.","KING - this piece is inspired by the Goal in Klinzha. The King, who begins the game off- board, has no movement powers of his own (except on the first move of the game) and must be carried by another piece. The first move of the game is, therefore, to move the King on top of the piece that will carry him. The Zillions version treats the King and the piece carrying him as a single piece. The ROYAL ROOK, ROYAL BISHOP, ROYAL KNIGHT, ROYAL RINGMASTER, ROYAL SATELLITE, and ROYAL WIZARD are the resulting pieces. Each royal piece retains the movement capabilities of its simple form, but may not move into or through check.","ROOK - rides any number of cell along a straight path between two pentagons.  The Rook may cross over from one surface of the board to the other, and back again.","BISHOP - rides in diagonal loops - defined as hexagonal cells connected by a line between two other cells. Players of many hexagonal chess variants will recognize this piece.  Each Bishop is confined to one surface of the board; it cannot cross over to the other side.","WIZARD - rides in pentagonal loops - defined as pentagonal cells connected by a line between two hexagonal cells. The Wizard moves on pentagons much as the Bishop does on hexagons, and was inspired by the hexagonal bishop. As a pentagonal piece, the Wizard is simultaneously on both surfaces of the board.  In this version, unlike the original Chess on a Soccer Board, one Wizard may not attack another.  This is because in the initial setup of the Symmetrical Version, each wizard is in position to attack another, and White could capture a Black Wizard on its first move if allowed to do so.  This would, in my opinion, give White an unfair advantage.","KNIGHT - leaps (a) from one hexagon to another hexagon three cells away, (b) from a hexagon to a pentagon three cells away, or (c) from a pentagon to a hexagon three cells away.  The Knight may cross over from one surface of the board to the other, and back again.","RINGMASTER - rides in hexagonal loops around a single pentagon. As each hexagon is adjacent to three pentagons, a Ringmaster may move in any one of three directions. Each Ringmaster is confined to one surface of the board; it cannot cross over to the other side.","SATELLITE - rides in crooked hexagonal loops around \"equators\", i.e., paths that divide the board equally in two. Each \"equator\" consists of ten hexagons and has five hexagons and six pentagons on either side of it. Each Satellite is confined to one surface of the board; it cannot cross over to the other side.","PAWN - moves one cell without capturing on hexagons, or captures by moving one cell from a hexagon to a pentagon, on which it morphs into a Guard. The Pawn, unlike its FIDE counterpart, may move backward or sideways as well as forwards. At the beginning of the game, every Pawn stands on top of another piece and must move off before that piece can move. The Pawn may not attack a royal piece (i.e., a piece carrying the King).  By changing into a Guard, a Pawn may cross over to the other surface of the board.","GUARD - moves one cell without capturing on pentagons, or captures by moving one cell from a pentagon to a hexagon, on which it morphs into a Pawn. At the beginning of the game, the Guard stands on top of the Wizard, and must move off before the Wizard can move. The Guard may not attack a royal piece (i.e., a piece carrying the King).  As a pentagonal piece, the Guard is simultaneously on both surfaces of the board.","HIDDEN PIECES - pieces with Pawns or Guards on top of them, and are paralyzer until the Pawn or Guard moves off. NOTE : if you are playing Zillions, the yellow and red pieces in the initial setup are really white and black pieces, respectively, with Pawns or Guards on them. When the Pawn or Guard moves off, the piece left behind will change colour.","ROYAL PIECES - ordinary pieces that are carrying a King. In Zillions, when the King mounts a piece, a crown appears above it.","HOW TO PLAY","The game begins by moving the King on top of the piece that will carry him. Any piece in the initial setup may be chosen.","Next, start moving Pawns and Guards off pieces. In the Zillions implementation, you will get an error message if you try to move a piece with a Pawn or Guard on top of it - \"Sorry, that piece cannot move now.\" Choose a piece, and click your mouse on the cell where you want the Pawn or Guard to move. It will move off, leaving the piece behind - which will change colour (yellow to white, red to black).","Pawns and Guards *may not* give check to a royal piece. You may well ask why not. When play-testing with Zillions of Games, I found that every game seemed to be like \"fool's mate\" in FIDE - every game lasted a mere 3-5 moves, with White winning every time. Frankly, I don't find \"fool's mate\" much fun - I like games to last a little while.

The end result is a game that can be taught quickly to newbies, and get them playing faster.","This version of Near Chess uses Drops and Shuffle as a way to set up the board.","SETUP","Depending on the version of the game, plays may or may not start with the pawns on the board.  Pieces are placed behind the pawns, if they are on the board.  In a 960 Shuffle version, pieces start on the board normally and are shuffled.  In free placement, players will place pieces into a certain zone (one version allows players free placement anywhere on the board).  In versions where the objective is to capture the enemy king, rather than checkmate, the kings will start on the board.","Please consult the specific rules for each variant.","RULES","Same as in standard FIDE Chess, except for the set-up and these rules which have been removed or changed:","Pawns only move one space forward and capture one space diagonally. There is also no En Passant.  This is because pawns start forward.","There is no castling.","Game is won by capturing the opponent's king, rather than checkmating it.  This eliminates stalemate.","Pieces only promote to those pieces that have been captured, except a pawn.  In other words, the player is limited to only one queen, two rooks, two knights, etc... A pawn is not permitted to move into the back row, unless it is able to be promoted to some other pieces, besides another pawn.","In some versions, plays may win the game by checkmating their opponent's king instead of capturing."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":15}

Besides normal castling one can choose to move the king three squares instead of two. The rook ends up on its usual square. The corner square provides a hiding nest for the king should the player want to invoke play on the same wing and advance with the pawns. The extended castle rule also makes play on the wings easier to achieve. Queenside castle becomes more attractive. The extra corner squares will enhance the strategical possibilities.","Neoorthodox Chess can also be played with an extra piece placed on the extra square.","(1) The Divaricator captures by withdrawing from one or two adjacent pieces positioned at an angle versus the movement direction.

The piece is automatically introduced at the position that is first left vacant when a piece leaves its initial square. The piece that first moves will also bring the external piece into play, so it is a double-move, comparable to castling.","Neoteric Chess is a relocation variant. Black can decide the initial positions of the kings, and White can then decide the initial positions of the queens. The positions must mirror each other. Neoteric Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the king + queen and another piece. The king may not swap with any of the rooks. The queen can be swapped with one of the rooks provided that the king remains between the rooks (this is a requirement of Chess960).","Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the kings thus have been swapped the turn is still with white. White can now relocate the queen, if he so wishes, and black then mirrors this. Next white starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules are simple and derive from Chess960. King and rook end up on their usual squares. The only difference is that the king can make longer leaps than usual (or shorter, or none at all). All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened. NOTE! If the King starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the Rook instead of the King.","With these relocation rules the bishops are always positioned so that there is still a choice to develop them on either of the queen's or the king's wing. There is at least one rook in its standard position. This maintains the strategical ambiguity of the initial position, while sound positions are produced where no definitive advantage can be obtained. Black relocates first. Thusly white gets a chance to make a strategical decision and create an initiative, as in the standard position. The possible twentyfive initial positions are a subgroup of Fischer Random Chess. The most conservative relocation, it seems, is to change place between king and queen, which is a convenient way of avoiding theory. Remember that the resultant castling positions are always the same as in standard chess. The standard position is included as an option.","This implementation will allow the user to test which pieces are suitable. It will be enhanced with more alternative pieces in later editions. Neoteric Chess is a relocation variant, designed to overcome the problem of opening monotony. Arguably, this method of reconfiguration of the initial array makes the procedure of Fischer randomization redundant. It also answers to the chessplayer's predilection for remaining in control.","So far, these pieces have been implemented: Swedish Cannon, Chancellor, Archbishop, Amazon, Mastodon, Dimachaer, Trebuchet, Kwagga, Divaricator, Murmillo, Culverin, Belfry, Adjutant and Zeppelin, Consul, Dragonet, Camel (3+1), Llama, Alpaca, Guanaco, and VicuÃ±a."],"image":"game1897_scr_NeotericChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":22}

The rules and components are","intended to be completely consistent with the text through A Dance with Dragons,","the latest in the series at the time of writing.","The game is played in a series of turns, alternating between the two players.

Once he has made his move,","his opponent's turn begins.","To perform a normal move, the player moves his selected piece from its current","square to an adjacent square one or more times, up to the movement allowance","determined by piece's type. A piece may not enter any square more than once","in a single turn, and it cannot end its movement in the same square it was on","before moving. A piece cannot enter a mountain square or a square occupied by","an opposing piece. A piece can be moved through squares occupied by other pieces","of its own color, but cannot end its movement on a square occupied by another","piece.","To perform a capture, the player observes the same rules as when performing","a normal move, except that he must move his piece on a straight path (i.e. only","in a single direction) and must end its movement on a square occupied by a piece","of his opponent's color, called the captured piece. In addition, the player must","check that the captured piece is sufficiently engaged - otherwise, the capture","cannot be made. Upon completing a capture, the captured piece is removed from","the game.","Every piece has an armor class and an engagement range, both determined by its type. A piece is considered to be engaged by an opposing piece if there is a straight path","between them whose distance is equal to or less than the opposing piece's engagement","range, and if the path does not pass through a mountain square or a square occupied","by a piece of the same color as the engaged piece.","A piece's armor class determines how many opposing pieces must be engaging that piece","for it to be captured: pieces with heavy armor must be engaged by at least two pieces,","pieces with light armor at least one, and unarmored pieces can be captured without","being engaged at all.

A band of villagers has risen up, grabbed their torches and pitchforks and sharpened their wooden stakes to confront this menace. Unfortunately, any villager attacked by Nosferatu does not truly die but rather becomes a vampire under his control. The only hope the villagers have of stopping this ever growing army of the undead is to slay the head vampire, Nosferatu.","OBJECTIVE: For the Vampires, it is to eliminate all the Villagers. For the Villagers, it is to capture Nosferatu.","ACTIONS: A 'move' consists of one of three types of actions: Entering, Attacking, or Moving. An attacking move must be made whenever possible; when no attack is available, entering takes precedence over moving.","ENTERING: The board starts off empty. The Vampires have six pieces, consisting of Nosferatu plus 5 Vampires.  The Villagers have 12 Men.  The Vampire player begins and places one of his pieces on any space on the board, except for the central hex. (Note: there is no particular order that the Nosferatu piece needs to be entered. It can be the player's first piece or his last, or anywhere in-between.) The players then alternate turns, placing their pieces on any open space on the board, with the restriction that a piece may not placed in any space that can come under immediate attack by an opponent's piece. The players must enter all their pieces on the board before they are allowed to move any of them. Thus the Vampires, who have half as many pieces as the Villagers, will usually begin moving first.","ATTACKING: Both Villagers and Vampires make captures as in Checkers, jumping over an opponent's piece to the empty space just beyond and continuing to jump and capture as long as it is possible. Jumps may be done in any of the six directions defined by a row of hexes.","Nosferatu, with his ability to change into a bat and fly, has far greater maneuverability than any other piece in the game. He may travel over any number of empty hexes on either side of a jump. Like the rest of the pieces, if he can continue jumping he must do so. When Nosferatu attacks a Villager, he has the choice of removing them from the board or having them remain in their position and be converted into Vampires.","Since we are dealing here with a bunch of bloodthirsty vampires and riotous villagers, all attacks are compulsory. Attacking takes precedence over any other action, including entering a piece. When given a choice of attacks, a player need not choose the move that results in the greatest possible number of attacks.","MOVING: A player may move a piece only when he has no more pieces to enter onto the board and when he has no attacks to make. Moving for both Vampires and Villagers consist simply of stepping onto an adjacent, empty cell.","Again, Nosferatu can fly as a bat, and so travel farther then the rest of the pieces.

Win is achieved by capturing the opponent's king. The players have the same pieces as in Shatranj, namely a king that moves one square in any direction; a general (firzan) that moves diagonally one step; two fils that jump diagonally two steps; two knights that move like chess knights; two rooks (rukh) that correspond to chess rooks, and eight pawns that move like chess pawns, except that there is no initial double-step. The today uncommon pieces general and fil have been marked with a red spot to remind the player that they move in the medieval manner. These medieval pieces are better suited for this game than modern chess pieces.","The die decides which piece can be moved. Click on the die to throw it. When rolling a six, the player may move the king, when rolling a five, the player may move the general, when rolling a four, the player may move a fil, when rolling a three, the player may move a knight, when rolling a two, the player may move a rook, and when rolling a one, the player may move a pawn.

Note that you are obliged to perform this procedure even if the die shows the number of a piece that you don't own anymore.

Octa-Ashtapada is an attempt to create a robust and enjoyable, though maybe aggravating,  game for this field.","First, the introduction of several new 3D Chess pieces: Amazon, Cardinal, Herald, Marshall and Prince.   The Amazon, Cardinal and Marshall have their origin in 2D Chess variant.  They, along with the Herald  which is unique to 3D Chess, combine the powerful slides with the Space Knight leap.  The Prince, having  its origin in Shogi, offers a new area of contention with its ability to become another King.","Next, the adjustment to the end-game condition.  Rather than checkmating the King, the player must capture  it.  With the promotion of the Prince, this can create several goals for the opponent.  So, promotion of  the Prince will offer a great advantage.  Thus, it is not necessary for the player to either avoiding or  remove a threat on a King.  Of course, it would be foolish to leave or place a solitary King in jeopardy.","The game will often begin with a battle between the various leaping power pieces.  Do not be squeamish.   Think of this part as the \"Battle of the Titans\".  The wall of Pawns will give you some protection, as  long as they are defended.  Be willing to sacrifice a non-sliding leaper for a sliding leaper.  This  portion of the game could last about 100 turns.  But a mistake by an opponent during this phase could  result in an early win.","After this first phase, the player might concentrate on seperating their King and Prince, while attempting  to remove the opponent's surviving Prince and promote their own.","A player having several Kings will greatly influence the opponent's strategy and overall structure of the  game.  With Pawns being able to promote to the Prince, the player has the option of introducing numerous  possible Kings to the field, thus creating further complications for the opponent.

The most interesting of these was Optima, a game in which players used 10 pieces chosen from a pool of 20, ensuring that each game was different and that relative piece values were not necessarily constant.  When the program Zillions-of-Games came out, I realized that I finally had a chance to playtest Optima.  In the process of learning Zillions language and implementing Optima, I revised the rules, adding new pieces to the pool and balancing the game by adding guards, a unit intermediate in power between pawns and pieces.  The result, I hope, is a game that is both tactical and positional, with difficult and interesting decisions regarding piece exchanges, and virtually infinite in its combinational possibilities.  But all of that, of course, is for the players to judge.","Board:  Optima is played on a checkered board 10 squares wide and 10 squares deep.","Goal:  To win, a player must checkmate or stalemate the opposing king.  A threefold repetition of a given position is a draw.","Initial Position:  Each player has 10 pawns on his third rank, 10 guards on his second rank, and 10 pieces, one of which is the king, off the board.","Piece sets:  In the equal-forces game, each player has the same 10 pieces, one of which is the king.  In the unequal-forces game, each player has a king, and 18 additional pieces are selected and form a \"pool\" belonging to both players until the placement phase is complete.","Placement:  Equal-forces: starting with white, each player in turn places one of his pieces on his first rank until it is full.  White then makes the first move of the movement phase.  Unequal-forces: All placement is to each player's first rank.  White places his king.  Black then places his king and selects and places one piece from the pool.  Players then alternate placing two pieces from those remaining in the pool.  Placement ends with white placing the last remaining piece and then making the first move of the movement phase.","Pawns:  By default, pawns move one or two squares in the four orthogonal directions, and capture one square in the four diagonal directions.  A pawn that reaches the 10th rank must promote to a Wizard, which is the most powerful piece in the game and is only available by pawn promotion.  Players who wish to use other pawn rules may, by agreement, change to another of the allowed pawn definitions.   To do this in Zillions, they will have to manually edit the zrf file.","Guards:  By default, a guard moves and captures one or two squares in any direction.  Guards do not promote.

If a pawn can move forwards to a square occupied by a piece of any colour, then the pawn and the piece can change place, also at the pawn's double-step. Exceptions are the king, and the friendly pawn, which cannot be displaced. Thusly, only kings and friendly pawns are capable of blocking a pawn. Should the pawn move to a piece placed on the last rank, then the pawn will be promoted to queen, without options. Otherwise regular rules apply.","While both pawns and pieces are affected by the swapping move, the relative values of pawns and pieces remain largely the same, although the pawn is slightly stronger. Although the pawn, in a sense, is stronger, it is also more vulnerable, while it has lost its blocking capability. Blocking an enemy pawn with a piece is now less efficient. The pawn's swapping move can be used to maneuver the pieces to better squares. There is also a more conservative variant where neither the kings nor the pawns, of any colour, are swappable. Phalanx Chess was invented and implemented by undersigned, August 2007. The primary piece graphics was created by P. Wong, Australia.","Phalanx: in military science, tactical formation consisting of a block of heavily armed infantry standing shoulder to shoulder in files several ranks deep.

{"zrfID":2349,"id":"philosophy-shogi-checkers","name":"Philosophy Shogi Checkers ","programmerID":380,"programmer":"Mats Winther","created":"2015-03-27","description":["Philosophy Shogi Checkers was invented by Inoue EnryÃ´, famous Japanese philosopher. The game was described by his student in 1890. It is similar to Anglo-Saxons checkers although it is played on a 9x9 board. Although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line (i.e. it is not necessary to choose the series of jumps that captures the most men). Philosophy Shogi Checkers is an attractive game; Anglo-Saxons checkers with a twist. It still revolves around acquiring material advantage, because the King cannot easily be attacked, unless it ventures out on the board in the middlegame.","The object is to capture the opponent's King, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can move forward, by sliding diagonally to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in any direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a Prince and can then move and capture forwards and backwards. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. The King moves and captures like the Prince.","Philosophy Shogi Checkers never ends in a draw (except by repetition), because there is no \"double corner\" where the King can go back and forth. Thus all King vs. King endgames are won. By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage generally leads to a win. A good strategy is to try and get the first Prince, because this piece will cause a lot of damage to the opponent, provided he cannot capture the Prince quickly. Try to hinder the opponent from getting a Prince, by keeping your lines closed so that he cannot break through. The King, together with the guardians on the adjacent squares, should remain in place until a later phase of the game. Thus, both the King and the promotion squares are protected.","I have invented a variant named \"Philosophy Checkers\" where the pieces may also capture orthogonally, as in Frisian draughts. This vouches for a much more combinatorial game. In this dynamic variant, a Man moves diagonally forward one step at a time. It can capture in all eight directions. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capture is mandatory, and one must always choose the line that captures the most pieces. The captured pieces remain on the board until the capture sequence is finished.","In this new variant, a Prince is a very powerful piece that can slide diagonally over empty squares and make \"long\" captures over empty squares, in all diagonal and orthogonal directions. It may also slide orthogonally, but on the dark colour squares only. (Thus, it is the same piece as the Dame in Scandinavian draughts.) Unlike the Man, it needn't land on the first empty square behind the captured piece. When making an orthogonal jump-capture, the capturing piece may only land on dark squares, while the other colour squares are neglected. Enemy pieces are captured one at a time, but several in sequence, if the position so allows. If the Man lands on a promotion square during a capture sequence, it does not promote. The King is the weakest piece. It moves and captures as in Anglo-Saxon checkers, diagonally forwards and backwards. The objective of the game is to capture the King.","Inoue EnryÃ´ (March 18, 1858 - June 6, 1919), Japanese philosopher, Buddhist reformer, educator, and nationalist; A key figure in the reception of Western philosophy, the emergence of modern Buddhism, and the permeation of the imperial ideology during the Meiji era. He is the founder of Toyo University and created the Temple Garden of Philosophy in Tokyo (cf.

When it takes, it must jump: when taking, the Cannon also moves over an orthogonal line, jumps over the first piece it meets (which may either be friendly or from the opponent) and then continues over the line until the next piece it sees: if that is from the opponent, the Cannon can take it by moving to that position.","Vao - When it isn't capturing, it moves like a Bishop; when it does capture, it moves diagonally like a Bishop, except that it must jump over a single intervening piece, which may belong to any player. It moves like a Bishop until it reaches this piece, leaps over it, and continues moving like a Bishop until it captures its target. When it isn't capturing, it may not leap; and it may not capture without leaping.","Super Pawn - The Super Pawn can move 1 space or jump 2 spaces: sideways or diagonally forward or straight ahead. (E,W,NE,NW,N)  Note that like a regular pawn it cannot go backwards. Unlike, normal pawns, it captures by replacement while making any of its moves. Jumped over enemy pieces are unaffected. En-passant rules do not apply, and it promotes to any piece just like a regular pawn.","Fast Pawn - The pawn's move is modified slightly to make it stronger and faster. The pawn can move 1 or 2 spaces forward anytime. It cannot jump and like a normal pawn it captures diagonally NE NW only. A pawn can capture en-passant an enemy pawn that made a double space move to bypass it.","Flexible Castling: The game utilizes flexible castling, which enables the king and rook to choose from 7 castling positions. The king and rook must be adjacent to each other after castling and the king cannot be in check or pass over attacked squares during castling.","Castling can be done by moving the king 1-3 (or 4 on Q-side) spaces towards the rook and moving the rook over and next to it. The most extreme wing castling occurs with the king moving 3 spaces (or 4 spaces on q-side) to the rook's square while the rook moves 1 space towards the king. Conversely the most centralized rook castling involves the king moving just 1 space words the rook and the rook filling the king's square. The choice of castling positions depends on whether a centralized rook or a king tucked away at the wing is more desired.","Note that while there are more castling options in this game, there are also more opportunities to not castle at all!

The positions must mirror each other. Placement Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the king + queen and another piece except the rooks. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the kings thus have been swapped the turn is still with white. White can now relocate the queen, if he so wishes, and black then mirrors this. Next white starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules derive from Fischer Random Chess. White castles in the following way (the Black procedure is equivalent). When castling left (O-O-O) , the king moves to c1 and the rook moves to d1. When castling right (O-O) the king moves to g1 and the rook moves to f1. The following conditions must be true: the king must not move to, from or over an attacked square; the king and rook have never moved; there is no other piece on any square over which the king and rook move. Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","Curtailed castling: in an alternative variant, if the king is positioned on the g or b file, castling is restricted to the side on which the king is positioned. The variant could be useful to enhance strategical predictability."],"image":"game1711_scr_PlacementChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":9}

The game board is cut down to a fraction of its original dimensions: a mere 6x8 board with 2 escape squares only available for the king - a total of 46 squares. There exists an underlying logic in this seemingly bizarre start position. There is no castling for the king is already at a wing (in the palace), and the objective of the game is not just checkmate (which wins as usual), but to escape the prison with your king by fleeing to the escape zone! The escape squares do not hinder the movement of any pieces.","For full details of the moves please see: https://chess.computerwebservices.net/prison.php","or search for game at chessvariants.org","The rules are as in orthodox chess except as noted below:","Pawns promote on the last rank to Ice-Queen Ninja-Guard,Flying Bomber or knight. Ice Queen will freeze opposing king rendering it unable to move thus it is checkmate!! - Unless there is an adjacent ice queen that makes it an icicle! In this case the king will be frozen but not checkmated! Try it out by playing both sides and moving the 2 enemy queens next to each other with the king in the vicinity.","The Ninja Guard's Moves ------------------------ The Ninja Guard is a color bound piece that can move one or two steps diagonally. It can leap over a diagonally adjacent friendly piece to land exactly 2 squares away (a two-space diagonal leap). It can capture on any square it lands, and additionally it can can capture an enemy piece that is diagonally adjacent by jumping over it. It can capture two pieces (the first immediately adjacent to it, and the next right after) in its path on a diagonal by jumping over the first one and capturing the second piece on the square it lands.","The Extra-mobile sliding pawn ------------------------------ The pawn moves and captures exactly as in orthodox chess except for the following. Normally, when a pawn faces an opposing pawn or an enemy piece, the pawn is blocked. However, the sliding pawn can, under these circumstances only if it is blocked, slide pass the enemy piece or pawn with the same 1-step diagonal movement that it would make when capturing.","The Ice Queen ---------------- Ice Queen can move to any adjacent square, capturing if possible and freezing all pieces around it! It steps/captures 1 square in any direction and Freezes all pieces it comes into contact with.  Note that if ice queen steps next to an enemy ice queen, it loses all freeze power, and becomes an icicle! Do not step in front of enemy queen! Note that the enemy ice queen should not try to move around or else they will both simultaneously freeze. Best to capture the icicle - be careful and never let an enemy ice q that stepped in front of yours reactivate.","The Flying Bomber's Moves ----------------------------------- The flying bomber's odd combination of long-range and short-range moves makes it a deadly weapon against an unsuspecting opponent.","Standard Move:","The flying bomber eliminates an enemy piece by flying over it, and landing on THE empty square immediately after it on the same orthogonal line. It cannot fly over or capture a second piece or land on any square beyond the first empty square.","The flying bomber can fly along any amount of empty squares (1-9) orthogonally, but not over any friendly pieces. This is identical to the movement of a rook.","For a successful bombing, there must be an empty square immediately after the first enemy piece on the same line.","Special Move: the Helicopter Landing","This is a special maneuver that enables the flying bomber to fly over the adjacent square, (jumping over, if occupied by friendly piece or eliminating if occupied by enemy piece) and land like a helicopter on a square exactly 2 squares away, capturing if possible on this square. It can capture two pieces in this manner.","Essentially, it combines its standard move with that of a two space orthogonal jumper."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[32,12],"variations":0}

It captures on the second leg only. The Provocator can also move by colliding against the margin, whereby only one movement direction is available after collision. Without screens to collide against the Provocator cannot move. The Provocator's value is the same as a knight or bishop (preliminary estimate). Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Provocator. As it can move only by coordinating with another piece, the Provocator is a highly cooperative piece, something which makes it interesting to the positional player. The structure on the board decides its possibilities. The Provocator has the interesting capacity of zigzaging between the pieces in the middlegame.

The Knight leaps up to the next point which centers its quadrangle then to an  \tadjacent point upon that quadrangle, or leaps to an adjacent point upon its  \tquadrangle then down to one of the four points which surround, or steps down  \tto one of the four points which surrounds its point. The Bishop leaps to the opposite point upon its quadrangle, or to the identical  \tpoint of an upper or lower quadrangle.  Movement up or down may be repeated if  \tthe point is empty and the next point is in the same direction as the last. The Rook moves to the adjacent points upon its quadrangle, or up to the point  \tcentered in its quadrangle, or down to any of the four points which surround  \tits point.

The King steps as either the Bishop or Rook.    The game is won by checkmating the King."],"image":"game759_scr_QuadrangleChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

Whenever a player captures a piece it goes to his reserve, changing color, so that it now belongs to him.

This changes game dynamics a lot, since now pieces can be returned to board, but at the cost of iniciative. Sometimes positions will be simplified, sometimes not. On board maneuver will be more valorized, but drops will still have an important role. Pawns may not be dropped on the last three ranks, and promoted Pawns turn back into Pawns when they are captured.

The revised Pawn, provided that it has reached the seventh rank, can also capture forwards. Due to this, passed Pawns are now more dangerous. In Revised Chess, drawish endgames will occur less often. Many theoretical endgames that have hitherto been drawn are now won. The additional capture-capability will also have an impact in the middlegame. It will not affect opening theory at all.","This method is a surprisingly simple way of introducing extra complexity. Comparatively, in orthodox chess a pawn is easy to block. This creates the marked drawishness of practical endgames. Therefore, most chessplayers prefer to keep the queen on the board, until they have created an advantage. Players can now exchange queen and enter a practical endgame, and, unlike before, the stronger player will tend to win. This is, arguably, a significant improvement compared with orthodox chess, although much analysis is needed to establish this.

It may move to  any adjacent empty space, or leap over any number of directly adjacent  pieces, regardless of owner, to land upon an empty space. The Twyk then  captures any piece, except the Do-od, which is directly between it and  another of its own Twyks. The player may capture, as a turn, any one piece  which is directly between two of their Twyks. Twyks may only be captured by  other Twyks.

Rococo started as an experiment in making a version of Ultima more favorable to attack and clearer in its play.  The result, however, is rather far from Ultima, but still seems to be an interesting game in its own right, where attack is stronger than defense, and that possesses reasonable clarity.","The object of Rococo is to capture the opposing side's King.  There is no check or checkmate.  A stalemate or three-times repetition a loss for the player unable to move or repeating the move.","The pieces:                   The Advancer captures by approach, and the Withdrawer by withdrawal. \t\t\t\t\t  The Long Leaper captures hostile pieces by leaping over them, although \tit may not leap over friendly pieces.  Multiple hostile pieces in a \tline with spaced between them may be captured in a single move. \t\t\t\t\t  The Swapper can change places with any piece of either side an \tunobstructed Queen's move away, or move like a Queen without \tcapturing.  It may also capture an adjacent piece by mutual capture \t(both the Swapper and the target are removed from the game). \t\t\t\t\t  The Immobilizer can not capture, but any hostile pieces next to it are \tunable to move. \t\t\t\t\t  Cannon Pawns move without capturing like Kings, and may leap over \tadjacent pieces of either side, landing just beyond, and capturing any \tpiece that might occupy the square landed in (capture by bombardment). \tOn any move that lands them on the back two ranks (counting the outer \tring), they may promote to any previously captured piece. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The Chameleon captures other pieces the way they capture, leaping over \tLong Leapers, approaching Advancers, etc.  It immobilizes opposing \tImmobilizers, and may Swap with opposing Swappers.

Every ship, except the Flagship, can slide any number of spaces horizontally or vertically, like a Chess Rook. The Submarine has the additonal power of being able to dive underneath a single intervening ship of either side.  It can only do this maneuver when repositioning itself.  A Sub must remain surfaced when attacking an enemy vessel.","The different types of vessels and the way they must be attacked are:","A - Aircraft-Carrier:  [Custodianship]  An Aircraft-Carrier is a massive warship that is much too powerful to be attacked by a single ship working alone.  Instead it requires two ships working together in order to sink it.  When a move is made that surrounds an enmey Aircraft-Carrier on two opposite sides, the sandwiched ship is sunk.  This an attack by custodianship.","B - Battleship:  [Cannonade]  A Battleship is a large warship.  To sink it requires a missle strike. An enemy Battleship can only be sunk if there is another ship, of either side, in between it and the attacker.  The attacking ship leaps over the intervening vessel and lands on the enemy Battleship, like a missle.  This is just like the capturing method of the Cannon from Chinese Chess.","C - Cruiser:  [Withdrawal] A Cruiser is a medium class warship. A salvo of artillery fire is required in order to sink it.  When the attacking ship begins adjacent to the enemy Cruiser and moves away from it in a straight line, the Cruiser is fired on and sunk.  This in an attack by withdrawal.","D - Destroyer: [Leaping]  Destroyers are small, light warships that are often assigned patrol or escort duty.  They can be sunk by being rammed.  If an attacking ship runs into a Destroyer, it rams through the enemy ship to the vacant space directly behind. If the space behind the ship is occupied, then the Destroyer can not be rammed.  After ramming the Destroyer, the attacking ship may continue to sail in the same direction.  This is an attack by a long leap.","S - Submarine:  [Displacement]  A Submarine is sunk by having the attacking ship float over the submerged Sub and dropping depth charges on top of it.  The attacking ship moves to same space as the enemy Submarine.  This is an attack by displacement.","F - Flagship:  [Advancement]  The Flagship is a specially modified frigate that carries the Admiral in command of the fleet.  Instead of the usual set of armaments, the Flagship is loaded with surveilance and communications equipment.  This allows the Admiral to monitor and coordinate the battle with all the ships in the fleet.  Unfortunately, this also means that the Flagship is unable to attack any enemy vessels.  Also, the ship is weighed down with the extra equipment.  This means it can only move one space orthogonally at a time.  The Flaghship is sunk through a torpedo strike. The attacking vessel moves towards the Flagship in a straight line and stops on the space immediately before it.  This is an attack by advancement.","Multiple captures are not possible.  A vessel must concentrate fire on one ship at a time.  Also, captures are not mandatory.  So if a ship makes a move that would result in a capture, they can decide simply to reposition themselves and leave the enemy vessel on the board.  A Flagship may not be used as the second ship in the custodian capture of an Aircraft-Carrier.

Inspired by greatest book. The \"Old Man and the Sea\" is a novel written by the American author Ernest Hemingway in 1951 in Cuba, and published in 1952. The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a battle between an old, experienced fisherman and a large marlin. The novel opens with the explanation that the fisherman, who is named Santiago, has gone 84 days without catching a fish.He sets his lines and, by noon of the first day, a big fish that he is sure is a marlin takes his bait. Unable to pull in the great marlin, Santiago instead finds the fish pulling his skiff. Two days and two nights pass in this manner, during which the old man bears the tension of the line with his body. Though he is wounded by the struggle and in pain, Santiago expresses a compassionate appreciation for his adversary, often referring to him as a brother. He also determines that because of the fish's great dignity, no one will be worthy of eating the marlin. On the third day of the ordeal, the fish begins to circle the skiff, indicating his tiredness to the old man. Santiago, now completely worn out and almost in delirium, uses all the strength he has left in him to pull the fish onto its side and stab the marlin with a harpoon, ending the long battle between the old man and the tenacious fish. Santiago straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and heads home, thinking about the high price the fish will bring him at the market and how many people he will feed. While Santiago continues his journey back to the shore, sharks are attracted to the trail of blood left by the marlin in the water. The first, a great mako shark, Santiago kills with his harpoon, losing that weapon in the process. He makes a new harpoon by strapping his knife to the end of an oar to help ward off the next line of sharks; in total, five sharks are slain and many others are driven away. But the sharks keep coming, and by nightfall the sharks have almost devoured the marlin's entire carcass, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail and its head. Finally reaching the shore before dawn on the next day, Santiago struggles on the way to his shack, carrying the heavy mast on his shoulder.","2.  Inspired by greatest film. Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Peter Benchley's novel of the same name. The prototypical summer blockbuster, its release is regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history.

It is about a London lawyer named Gabriel John Utterson who investigates strange occurrences between his old friend, Dr Henry Jekyll, and the evil Edward Hyde.","The work is commonly associated with the rare mental condition often spuriously called split personality, referred to in psychiatry as dissociative identity disorder, where within the same body there exists more than one distinct personality. In this case, there are two personalities within Dr Jekyll, one apparently good and the other evil; completely opposite levels of morality. The novella's impact is such that it has become a part of the language, with the very phrase Jekyll and Hyde coming to mean a person who is vastly different in moral character from one situation to the next.

The Elephant (Chancellor) combines the powers of a Rook and a Knight. It is comparable in strength to the Queen. The Hawk (Cardinal) combines the powers of a Bishop and a Knight. It is somewhat weaker than a Queen. These pieces are known from Capablanca's Chess.","Whenever a piece leaves its initial square, one of the extra pieces can immediately be introduced to the vacant square. So this is a double move, comparable to castling. Should a player refrain from inserting his extra pieces at these occasions, then he has forfeited his chance of introducing them. When castling, one of the extra pieces can be placed on either of the squares left vacant, namely the corner square, or the e1/e8 square.","Note! When making a move that allows you to introduce a piece, but you still want to keep it in the reserve, then you must acknowledge this by lifting and dropping the external piece. Pawns can, additonally, promote to Elephant or Hawk.","Alternative variant","I introduce an alternative variant (program SeirawanChess-alternative.zrf) where the external pieces must, in the first moves, be placed on the file on which the player intends to introduce the pieces. If, for instance, the player places the external piece behind his own queen, then the piece is automatically introduced on the queen's initial square when the queen moves away. If a piece is placed behind the king then it is also introduced at castling. The same is true if the external piece is placed behind the rook. Should a piece on the initial position be captured (exchanged), then the player has forfeited his right to introduce an external piece placed behind it.","Note! The player is not allowed to position one piece on the king file and one on the rook file. This rule will prevent him from introducing two pieces simultaneously at castling. This variant solves the problem of the bishop fianchetto mentioned above. This method of introducing external pieces is probably ideal while the strategical situation is clarified before play begins.

In Shogi, captured pieces belong to the player who takes them and may be replayed later in the game as a turn. Captured pieces may be placed on any unoccupied square, except for Pawns, which can be placed only on unoccupied squares on columns without any friendly Pawns.  This implementation of Shogi is a modification of the Shogi Script by Fergus Duniho. I have created three seperate Shogi Scripts, as follows:","Beginner's, with the notation using English names and no traditional Japanese Kanji Pieces.","Traditional Shogi Set, with letters and numbers on the board to denote the grid lables, something that is frequently done in printed Shogi material.","Large Shogi Board, with a mix of pieces that are traditional and for beginners. It's just, well, big, using larger grapics. The most important alteration I made to Mr. Duniho's Shogi Script, though, was to include handicaps. One of the nice things about Modern Shogi is that it has a well defined and workable handicap system, where the stronger player moves first, but has less pieces. The greater the difference in playing strength, the larger the handicap. I have included a total of 10 handicaps, from the small Left Lance handicap all the way to the challenging (!!) 8 Piece handicap.  And while handicaps do allow weaker players a better chance to win, they also serve as an exercise for the stronger player to practice more challenging play too.  Please note that in all the handicaps, White moves first, not Black! The rationale being that Black's first move is considered to be the removal of the pieces White shall not be using. Note too that the missing pieces will be unavailable for either side to use.  Note that one of my main reasons for creating this set of shogi scripts is so that shogi players can record their games with Zillions as well as use it for playing live games on the Internet, using handicaps."],"image":"game853_scr_Shogi_Handicaps.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,37],"variations":11}

One is for Shogi, one is for Mortal Shogi, and one is for Kamikaze Mortal Shogi. They are bundled together because they use many of the same graphics, and they should appeal to a common audience. Shogi is the Japanese form of Chess. Mortal Shogi is a new Shogi variant, created by Roberto Lavieri and Fergus Duniho, in which captured pieces demote, and captured Pawns disappear all together, allowing overall material to decrease during the game. Kamikaze Mortal Shogi is an improved version of Mortal Shogi, created by Fergus Duniho, in which captured Pawns demote to Kamikazes. Kamikazes leap two spaces forward, and they disappear upon capturing or being captured.","The Shogi ZRF is a major update to one I first wrote in 1999. It is faster, smarter, and better-looking than the Shogi ZRF that comes with Zillions of Games. The other two ZRFs are based on this ZRF. Here are the main advantages of my Shogi ZRF over ZoG's. (1) It handles drops much more efficiently. (2) Piece values have been finetuned. (3) Neither side is limited to capturing 27 pieces without dropping any, for excess captured pieces can overflow to the other side. (4) The board is flippable, and flipped piece sets are included, allowing you to play White from your own perspective. (5) Besides the graphics that come with ZoG, it includes four more piece sets and two more boards, and it lets you pick any combination of board and pieces. (6) It uses arabic numeral / roman letter coordinates instead of the arabic numeral / roman numeral coordinates used by the official Zillions script. Numeral/letter coordinates are more standard, and I personally find letters easier to identify than roman numerals.","Back in 1999, Zillions had recently debuted, and it had come with its own Shogi ZRF, but it played poorly, had poor graphics, and met with other problems too. So, on opposite sides of the globe, Steve Evans and I each began to write a new Shogi ZRF. I focused on making drops more efficient. Steve focused on fixing piece values, for ZoG's ZRF was valuing Bishops and Rooks more than their promoted counterparts. I released mine first, and instead of releasing his too, Steve told me what he was doing, and I combined our ideas together. After ZoG2 debuted in 2003, I improved the ZRF even more. I made drops somewhat more efficient by optimizing the code better. I also discovered a way to finetune piece values without adding redundant moves. I went on to make individual variants with different tunings of piece values. One tuning was based on piece values that are generally accepted among Shogi authorities. Others have been based on my own hypotheses and experiments. While extensive testing is time-consuming, what tests I have done have revealed that my ZRF plays better than ZoG's and also better than such freeware programs as Steve Evans's Shogi Variants, Glen Miner's Winshogi, and even Pauli Misikangas's Shocky 2.05. It is no match for good commercial and shareware Shogi programs, but it does come with nicer graphics and has all the user-friendliness of ZoG.","Below are reduced images of two of the graphic sets available. One shows abstract symbolic pieces on a checkered board, while the other shows single-character Japanese pieces on a marble board. Both are the same dimensions as the boards that come with Zillions. The two piece sets shown are the only sets used by Kamikaze Mortal Shogi, since they are the only two that include a Kamikaze piece. But Shogi and Mortal Shogi may use any set included with Zillions plus two other sets created by myself. One is a diagrammatic set, while the other is based on Armando Marroquin's Chess Motif font. In the symbolic set shown below, as well as in the Motif set not shown, Gold and Silver Generals are represented by alchemical symbols for Gold and Silver. These correspond to the astrological symbols for sun and moon. Most other pieces in the symbolic set are based on my Abstract set for Chess variants."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,23,34],"variations":22}

A Sissa moves as follows: in one turn, first, the Sissa moves one or more squares like a rook or a bishop, and then the Sissa moves the same number of squares like the other of the two (bishop or rook). So, the Sissa has the following options:","First, it moves a number of squares as a rook. Then it makes a corner of 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees, and then moves the same number of squares as a bishop.

Then, it makes a corner of 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees, and then moves the same number of squares as a rook. Again, all squares passed by must be empty. Bishops have, in addition to their normal diagonal movement, one extra property: the bishop moves one square horizontally or vertically at the first time it moves during the game. This may be done only once, with one of the players bishops. Also, for one of the bishops of the player, the first move made with this bishop must be of this special type. This move is called conversion. Note that a player may choose which bishop he converts, but if he makes a normal move with one of his bishops, the first move made with the other bishop must be a conversion move. Note also that a player never can make more than one conversion move in a game, and a promoted bishop does not make conversion moves. It is possible to take a piece of the opponent by conversion.  I don't know the castling roles of Sissa. So I have taken the role of Symmetric Sissa, which was invented by Cetina in the same year: The king goes always three steps in castlings.   Sissa is a chess variant invented in 1998 by Carlos Cetina. The piece called Sissa is taken from another chess variant of Cetina, called Coherent Chess.

Before starting, the players must decide whether they want to use the extra pieces. To make a decision, press on the little black square. Only if both players choose not to use the extra pieces, then it becomes a regular game of chess. If white turns down the extra pieces, then black can overrule this. Right-click on a piece to get more information.","If players have elected to include external pieces, they may either move a piece or pawn, or drop an extra piece from the reserve. Pieces may only be dropped on a friendly pawn on the second rank. The removed friendly pawn must immediately be relocated two squares ahead of the dropped piece. This position, and the position in between, must be empty. If not, the piece cannot be dropped on the friendly pawn. Should a player refrain from inserting his extra pieces at these occasions, then he has forfeited his chance of introducing them. Note that pieces and pawns are allowed to move before an extra piece has been dropped. You are allowed to make a pawn-relocation if in check, if the pawn-relocation covers the check. The relocated pawn can be captured by 'en passant'.","The extra pieces are the following. Chancellor (Princess) : combines the powers of a Rook and a Knight. It is comparable in strength to the queen. Swedish Cannon : after having jumped any piece, the Swedish cannon can slide and capture like a rook. However, if no jump move exists it's allowable to slide like a rook, but without capturing. The Swedish Cannon has about the same value as a bishop. The closest relative of the Swedish Cannon is the Korean Cannon. The Swedish Cannon was invented by undersigned, April 2007. It derives from Swedish Cannon Chess. The Archbishop was known already in the 17th century. D. Pietro Carrera used this piece in his variant Carrera's Chess. He wrote a long book on chess, called 'Il Gioco delgi Scacchi', and published it in 1617 in Miltello in Sicily.","In Stahlberg Chess standard chess is included as an option, thereby maintaining the historical connection. In a tournament, by way of the initial voting procedure, players can decide to play a traditional game.","Introducing the external pieces implies a weakening of the pawn chain, so it's a difficult strategical question whether one should wait, or immediately make use of the drop move to advance a centre pawn two steps. But dropping an extra piece on the king- or queen pawn could block the development of the bishop. Waiting has its obvious advantages, although the alternative positions where the piece can be dropped will become fewer and fewer.","The Swedish Cannon can take active part early in the game, so one ought to introduce it early. The Cannon can be exchanged for a light piece that has acquired a good position, or it can threaten an enemy rook on an half-open file. The Swedish Cannon is stronger than both its counterparts, the Korean Cannon and Chinese Cannon, making it easier to introduce it in a context of Western pieces. Its movement is similar to the Korean Cannon, but the Korean Cannon is stranded when no jump moves are available. This cannot befall the Swedish Cannon while it is then, and only then, allowed to slide like a rook, but without capture. Interestingly, if the enemy Cannon has no jumps, then one can sometimes position a piece so as to provide a jumping option, thus preventing the Cannon from using his right to move like a rook. Stahlberg Chess was invented and implemented by undersigned, May 2007.","Stahlberg Chess was created in remembrance of Swedish grandmaster Gideon StÃ¥hlberg (1908-67), Sweden's first official grandmaster. StÃ¥hlberg became Scandinavian Champion in 1929. His rating for the year 1949 has afterwards been calculated to 2750, and he was the third strongest player in the world in that year. StÃ¥hlberg umpired in the 1963 Botvinnik - Petrosian World Championship match. He wrote several quality chess books, and co-authored a book with Golombek: Chess and Chess Masters: The Greatest Players of the Mid-20th Century. His style of play is reminiscent of J.R.

In the year 1011 A.D., Bishop Arnulf II of Halberstadt was brought a Wendish duke by the name of Guncellin as a prisoner. Guncellin was incarcerated in the Stroebeck watchtower, where he was guarded by local peasants. Boredom tormented not only the noble prisoner, but his guards as well. Guncellin carved 32 chess figures and painted a chess board on the table. Then he taught the guards how to play the game. Chess thrived in the village and was passed down from generation to generation. It was played in families, in the village tavern and in the weaving shops. This was at a time when chess was normally restricted to the royal courts and monasteries. Despite the almost complete destruction of Stroebeck in the Thirty-Years War (1618-1648), the chess tradition has remained alive up to the present day.","In Stroebeck, chess games with living figures (see the screenshot) began in 1688. In Germany, Stroebeck is unique with respect to its school: Since 1823, chess is a compulsory subject in Stroebeck's secondary school.

This will lead to more than 20 pupils for the crucial class 5.  Rumor has it that the international Zillions publication of \"Stroebeck Crisis  Chess\" helped leading to this decision.","\"Stroebeck Crisis Chess\" is almost traditional chess.

The object for the White side is to move his King (Hnefi) to one of the corner squares, in which case he has successfully escaped. The object for the Black side is to capture the White King. Black makes the first move.","All pieces move like a Rook in chess, that is, any number of squares horizontally or vertically. No pieces, except the King, may land on the corner squares or the centre square. The centre square is the King's throne (Konakis).","Tablut employs orthogonal interception-capture. When an enemy piece is surrounded on two opposite sides, the piece is captured. The corner and centre squares also act like friendly pieces, so if an enemy piece is sandwiched between a friendly piece and these special squares, this also results in capture. Capture is not mandatory. Note that the central square only functions as capture square when it's empty. (In an alternative variant, it needn't be empty to function as capture square.)","The same capture rules applies also to the King, except when it is positioned on the centre square, when it must be surrounded on all four sides. If the King is positioned on any of the four squares adjacent to the centre, it must be surrounded on three sides, plus the centre square, which then functions as a capture-square.","Tablut boards and pieces are often found in Viking graves. Pieces are typically made of bone, glass, or amber. The game had a rich history in Viking tales. In one such story King Knut and Jarl Ulf were playing, and Knut made mistake allowing Ulf to capture a piece. Knut requested that he be allowed to take back his move. Ulf refused, toppling the board, and an argument ensued that ended when Ulf was killed.","The Swedish botanist Carolus LinnÃ¦us, the inventor of the system for classifying plants and animals we still use today, wrote about this game in his diary in 1732. He discovered it during his travels in Lapland, where the game had survived and was still played among the Lapps. The side with the King represented the Swedes, while the other side respresented Moscovites.","Watch out whenever a piece is positioned orthogonally adjacent to an opponent's, as it's liable to get captured. Exchanging pieces early in the game would generally benefit White rather than Black, because White needs open space to escape with his King. Black should try to keep the position crowded. Both sides should look out for King moves that allow the King two different paths to the rim, since it will be impossible to block both directions at the same time.","Four variants have been implemented: Tablut (9x9), Brandubh (7x7), Large Hnefatafl (13x13), and Alea Evangeli (19x19). Tablut seems to be a well-balanced game. It's a tough nut to crack, although Black should probably win in the end. In Brandubh White can sometimes achieve a rapid win, but Black's chances seem the best. White could build a fortress, making the king invulnerable, with the intent of repeating moves within the fortress. But this only means that White has lost, while there is no way out and there are only two results: win or lose. If White repeats moves, he loses, too.","Tablut and Large Hnefatafl derive from Scandinavia and are probably more original than Brandubh and Alea Evangelii (The Evangelic Game), which were played on the British islands. Note that the implementation of these games on the Zillions CD (\"Tafl\") uses incorrect rules. In Alea Evangelii the rules are different. If the white King reaches the rim the game is won. The whole periphery functions as capture square.","This implementation follows the rules researched by the Historical Museum, Stockholm, and it shows what a sophisticated game Tablut is.

Russian stacking chess.","Tavreli uses multiple grids which require at least version 1.3 of Zillions.","Zillions 1.2 has a bug which causes scripts with multiple grids to miscompile into a single grid with extended position lables.","If you are still running Zillions 1., Zillions version 1.3.1 is available for free from Zillions-of-games.com/patches-131.html.","Because of the complexity of Tavreli stacking rules, this game takes Zillions a long time to load.  Please be patient.","Tavreli is a game very like European Chess played long ago in Russia.  Tavreli has recently revived in popularity in Russia.  The object is the same: checkmate the King, who is called Magus in Tavreli.  In this implementation, standard English names are used for the other pieces.  The starting lineup is identical.  The moves and capture rules are the same, including castling, en-passant capture, and promotion upon arrival on the opponent's back row.","How does traditional Tavreli differ from standard European Chess?","The most notable difference from standard European Chess is that Tavreli pieces are flat discs that stack.  Tavreli pieces are distinguished, not by their shapes, but by icons that show the directions of their moves.  Pieces are never removed from the game of Tavreli.  Instead, your piece just lands on top of them.  On any later move you may move the entire stack according to the move or capture powers of the top piece.  Or you may split the stack at any point, leaving the bottom piece(s) where they were.  Whichever piece you leave on top of the abandoned portion of the stack you split will control the future movement of any piece(s) left below.  The exposed piece will have lost any promotional powers they may have acquired.  In traditional Tavreli, you would rarely want to split one of your controlled stacks, leaving on top any piece that was not yours originally.","Another important difference is that you may move on top of your own pieces.  Although this move is like capturing your own piece(s) in that the covered piece(s) will lose any promotional powers, moving on top of your own piece(s) is a move, not a capture: your Pawn may not use its diagonal capture to step on top of your own piece(s), only its normal forward one or two space move.  The Magus may step on top of any stack, but no friendly piece may step on top of the Magus.","Promotion occurs when appearing alone or on top of a stack by move or by capture or by being left alone or on top of a split stack on the opponent's back row.  Promotion is not a choice in Tavreli.  Traditional Tavreli pieces are all marked on their edges as well as on their faces with the symbol for their kind of piece, so that players can identify the components of a stack without touching them.  Each traditional Tavreli Pawn is also marked on its edges and on its flip side with the insignia of whichever piece that that Pawn starts in front of.  No matter where he may end up on top in the opponent's back row, that Pawn will promote to the piece whose mark he bears.  The Pawn who begins in front of the Magus does not become a second Magus.  The Magus' Pawn will become a Helgi.  The Helgi can do anything that a Bishop, Horse, or Rook can do.","How does this Tavreli differ from traditional Tavreli?","Every piece that you land on top of will become yours.  So on any later move you can split any of your stacks at any point and both stacks will remain yours.","Every piece in this game can move forward like a Pawn, one or two spaces straight forward from any position on the board where they may have reached or been left on top of a split stack, at any point in the game.  The space moved onto must be empty or have one of your own on top.  When you move two spaces, the intermediate space must be entirely empty and, if the piece moving two spaces does not have the Rook's move (Rook, Queen, Marshall, or Helgi), the piece moving two spaces and those pieces he dragged with him may be captured en passant by any opposing piece (not just by a Pawn) on the opponent's very next turn, as if the moving piece and stack were to have moved only one space.","The Magus (and his promoted form the Nugus) can castle with one of his Rooks or any of his pieces having a Rook's move (Rook, Queen, Marshall, or Helgi) any number of times during the game (even across check and even to get out of check) whenever one of his rook-movers sits on the same horizontal rank with their Magus, at least two open spaces away, and with no other pieces in between.  The Magus slides two spaces toward the rook-mover.  The rook-mover piece leaps over to the other side of the Magus, landing on the empty space that the Magus just slid over.  If your Magus is sitting on a stack when you begin castling, you may choose how many underlings to carry with the Magus, leaving behind the bottom portion, just as for any other move.  If your rook-mover is sitting on a stack when castling, the rook-mover will carry all of their underlings with them, leaving no one behind.","The traditional Tavreli restriction that no friendly piece can cover the Magus does not apply to this Tavreli.  While covered, the Magus is unable to perform his normal moves, including castling.  If your Magus' stack is captured by the enemy, you lose, the same as when your Magus is on top or alone.","Every piece in this game can promote.  Promotion occurs when a piece appears alone or on top of a stack by move or by capture or by being left on top of a split stack on the opponent's back row.  Promotion is according to where the piece lands or is left, not according to where it began.  Unless the piece should already possess the powers of the piece that starts on the space where it lands, every piece, except the Magus, will acquire that space's starting piece's power, keeping all its prior abilities except diagonal capture when a Pawn is promoted to Horse or Rook.  When arriving or being left on top of the opposing Magus' starting space, every piece, except the Magus, becomes a Helgi.  A Pawn will become a Rook, Horse, Bishop, Queen, or Helgi, according to where he lands.  Horses and Queens become Helgis on each other's spaces or on the Magus' starting space.  Bishops and Rooks become Queens on each other's spaces or on the Queen'a starting space.  Rooks and Horses will become Marshalls on each other's starting spaces.  Horses and Bishops will become Cardinals on each other's starting spaces.  The Magus becomes a Nugus on any space of the opponent's back row, adding the power of the Horse to his movement and castling powers.  All promotions are temporary.  As in traditional Tavreli, promoted pieces will lose all their promotions when captured or landed on by their own pieces.","For details on how to play, please read also the strategy help inside the game.","How did they invent Tavreli?","Tavreli may have developed from the use of flat pieces with markings on their faces, similar to and perhaps infuenced by the Chinese or Korean chess pieces.  These flat pieces would have been easier to manufacture than the more elaborately carved pieces used in Africa, India, the Middle East, and Europe.  Marking pieces with their movement diagrams may have easier for Russian or possibly Scandinavian people to learn than the Chinese characters used on both the Chinese and Korean pieces would have been.  Marking the reverse sides of the flat pieces with their promoted values could have been influenced by Japanese chess which also uses flat pieces with fixed promotions.","Stacking the pieces is most probably a native Russian innovation.  Marking the edges of the pieces with their icons would have then become a requirement so players would not need to remember what was in the stack.  The requirement for promotion on a round piece limits the possibility of acquiring or recruiting captured pieces, unlike the pointed Japanese pieces which can show both their promotional and their team status.","The current double move for the Pawn, en passant capture, and castling rules were probably added to Tavreli more recently as they were added to western European Chess.","Recruiting of captured enemy pieces, the double move for Pawns from any position, pawn-move for other pieces, en-passant capture by pieces other than the Pawn, promotions according to position of arrival, promotions for pieces other than the Pawn, castling across check, castling to escape check, castling with rook-movers other than Rooks, castling more than once, are all new to this version of Tavreli.","Because of the difficulty of tracking and showing stacking pieces in a strictly two-dimensional implementation like Zillions of Games, this is probably the first computerized implementation of Tavreli.","This Zillions implementation is dedicated to Valentin Chelnokof of Kazan.

Below is a game I played of it with Zillions which has most everything                 shown, terrain-wise.                                 The terrain types are as follows:                                 Nothing - A normal square, before anything has landed on                 it. It does nothing.                Grass - Grass, a harmless terrain type left behind by pawns,                 and sometimes the King.                Mud - A thick brown ooze of dirt and water, left behind by                 Knights.                Water - A large puddle, left behind by Bishops.                Ice - A small patch of ice, left behind by the Queen.                Void - The absence of all matter, left behind by the Rook.                                                The above types of terrain are left behind on the square that the                 corresponding piece has just vacated. The terrain types have these                 effects on pieces:                Grass - None                Mud - Any sliding piece (Queen, Bishop, Rook) stops their                 slide at a patch of mud.                Water - Only the Rook and Knight can land on a patch of water.                 The Knight, however, cannot leap _over_ water.                Ice - Only the Queen and Bishop may land on ice.                Void - Only the King may land on the Void, but the Rook may                 slide past it.                                                The only exception to these rules is the King - if the King is on                 a normal unterrained square, it leaves behind Grass, otherwise it                 leaves whatever is already there.

All                 the standard chess pieces in Terror Chess move in the same way they                 do in normal chess. The additional pieces of the Cardinal, Marshall,                 and Terror are all well known chess variant pieces. I have graphically                 depicted the Terror in consistent manner as the Marshall and Cardinal,                 which makes Terror Chess very easy to learn and play for anyone                 who already knows standard chess.                 The                 idea behind Terror Chess came to me after playing some other large                 chess variants which used the Marshall and Cardinal with the standard                 chess set. Games like Capablanca's Large Chess thus have pieces                 representing all dual combinations of the three basic piece movement                 types: bishop movement, knight movement, and rook movement. Terror                 Chess adds in the Terror, which combines all three movement types.                                 Please                 send me any bug reports or thoughts about the game.

Instead the Trebuchet, when it moves, has the power to sling a piece located behind itself to a forward square in the alignment direction. The slung piece, which can be of any colour, is the nearest piece in the opposite direction of the move. This piece is hurled to the square immediately forward of the square on which the Trebuchet stops. Any enemy piece positioned here is captured. Thus the Trebuchet can be used for transporting friendly pieces, attacking enemy pieces, or removing enemy pieces from good positions. In opening and middlegame the Trebuchet introduces new tactical themes. If it remains on the first rank it can transport the rooks and the king very effectively along the first rank. In the endgame it can transport friendly pawns and the friendly king over the board. It can open files for the rooks, by removing a friendly pawn sideways. Pawns can be catapulted to their promotion square, when they are promoted to queen as only alternative. Pawns cannot be catapulted to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit. Kings and rooks retain their castle rights if catapulted away and back, while they haven't moved by their own accord. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Trebuchet. The Trebuchet's value is the same as a bishop (preliminary estimate). The movement of the Trebuchet makes an authentic impression, and is close to how Trebuchets were used in reality.

The game rules was invented by Ruggero Micheletto for the  1999 contest of the Large Chess Variants. Full rules description  can be found at  http://www.chessvariants.com/large.dir/contest/ultrachess.html.","Here the idea of game creation is introduced by its author.","In the past Xianqi had to move from Asia to the Aristocracy in  Europe. People of that times felt the necessity to introduce King  and Queen to fit the spirit of that age.  What they did, was to create nowadays chess as we know it.","In another variant I was considering, I tried to reproduce Xianqi  as it was, a War game, with a General (King), two powerful warrior  at his side (Queens) and so on.","There is another possibility, I think also reasonable and logical,  to introduce the King and Queen as our ancestors wanted.  The only way to do that without removing one of the powerful warriors  - and then create the nowadays 8x8 chess game - is to leave all the  war pieces as they are, and to substitute the single piece general  with the two pieces King and a Queen. In this way the board gets  10x10 and everything is symmetric.","For reason of space, the pawns must obviously move more forward,  that's why I introduced a 3rd steps forward.","Due to the lot of space the strategy in this variation should be  really great, this game should be very open and complex. The player  has all the space and pieces to use his creativity.","The Soldiers are introduced, like two modern chess Queens in a 10x10  checkerboard.","Every piece can move one step in every direction (!) I introduced  this rule as it is. It is necessary to increase the general power  of the pieces. A mere Knight or Bishop in a 10x10 board is easily  taken by the opponent team. Things are different if they can move  one step in any direction.","This gives a lot of flexibility to pieces movement and equilibrate  the super attack power of two Soldier on the board.  Just imagine to have a Bishop on a diagonal, and just shift it on  another one... a great new potential in gameplay.","The Queen moves only in any direction like her King.

Only knight pawns on the fifth rank have this capability. The pawn loses this capability when it advances to the 6th rank. Compared with standard chess, this means that an advanced knight pawn is endowed with an extra jump move. Valiant Chess is specially designed for rapidchess, since it makes the game more aggressive and less monotonous. Aggressive play on the flanks is facilitated as the Valiant pawn makes it possible to pry open the pawn chain, something which greatly enhances attacking play. In this way one can open the file in order to attack the king, or disrupt the position for attacking purposes. This new rule favours the advance of the knight pawn, which leads to a more aggressive game.","In an alternative variant both the knight- and rook pawn, having advanced to the fifth rank, can make this knight jump to empty square. This could lead to wild play. The most conservative variant is to allow the jump only when the pawn is blocked.","In the general case, it is easy to control these extra destination squares, or to occupy them, thus preventing the pawn from going there. In many cases it is simply bad to go there. However, it opens up many new attacking possibilities. This pawn move isn't illogical. It moves forward one rank, which is natural to the pawn. Keep in mind that the pawn is already different from all other pieces in that it can only advance to an empty square, different from the capture square. In this variant, yet another pawn advance to empty square is added, provided that the pawn is positioned at the knight file and the fifth rank. It is a natural move that already belongs in chess in the form of the knight jump. Interestingly, there is a corresponding rule in Xiangqi (Chinese Chess). When the pawn passes the middle line it acquires the capacity to move sideways. See also Dynamic Chess.

(It can be called both, because the game is called Vortex                 Chess, but the piece-name I put in for the vortex itself was \"Portal\",                 and I didn't notice it at the time due to my caffeinated state.                 :P)                                 The setup is as below, with white's vortex (the blue one) on the                 fourth rank on the far left, and black's (the red one) on the fifth                 to the far right.                                 The effect of the vortex is as follows: Any piece that would otherwise                 land on the space occupied by the vortex, its path is transplanted                 onto the space in that same direction from the other vortex.                                 For example, from the opening move, the leftmost pawn of White can                 move to the sixth rank on the far right, because it has an opening                 move of two.                                 The movement of the vortex piece is simple - it can move to any                 unoccupied square. At first I thought this might make it too easy                 to defend a King in check, but upon seeing Zillions' response to                 this tactic, I realized that the portal can only defend the King                 if there is only one space between the King and the attacker, as                 the opponent can always place their portal next to yours, in effect                 nullifying it.                                 Knights take a little getting used to in Vortex Chess, depending                 on how you remember how they move. A Knight can leap over a portal,                 but if it lands on one, it moves diagonally from the other, not                 orthogonally, which is what a person might think if they use the                 L-shape movement for ease of remembering. :)                                 This ZRF has two variations - the default allowing movement of the                 portals only once every other turn, by alternating sides. The variant                 allowing movement of the portals during each turn by both sides."],"image":"game942_scr_VortexChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":2}

The Treacherous Fox may jump to the second square in any of the directions. The Heavenly Horse can jump in the same way as a Knight in Western Chess,but only in the forward and reverse directions. The Cloud-Eagle can move to the second or third squares on the forward diagonals only if the intervening squares are vacant.

This magic piece can change movement capability by using up a move to transform itself. A Warlock rook can change into a Warlock cannon by turning the rook upside down, or vice versa. The Warlock cannon uses Korean Cannon movement: it moves as a rook after having jumped a piece. If it cannot jump then it cannot move. As such, it is somewhat weaker than a knight, but its tactical capacity is great. In any case, the Warlock cannon can always transform itself back into a Warlock rook. After the piece is transformed it must make a move before making yet another transformation. So it's not possible to stay put and make continual transformations on the same square.    The Warlock has great attacking potential, and it's much easier to maneuvre than the clumsy rook. It is more valuable than a rook, but it costs time to transform back and forth between its cannon and rook guises. Warlock means sorcerer, witch, or conjurer. The primary piece graphics was created by P. Wong, Australia.    There is also a variant with an \"improved pawn\", which has an additional movement direction. The improved Pawn, provided that it (1) has reached the fifth rank, and (2) the forward movement is blocked, has the additional moves of a knight, but only in two forward directions: east-north-east, and west-north-west, and only to empty squares. There are no additional capture moves. Middlegame and endgame are more aggressive while improved Pawns are not easy to block.

Troyka","description":["Weave \u0026 Dungeon is a warped game. It is played on a 9x9 weave pattern set against a black background. The white spaces as a group are called the Weave. The black spaces are called the Dungeon. The Weave and the Dungeon constitute separate playing fields that interact with one another. Motion on the Weave is twisting and non-Euclidian. Motion in the Dungeon is traditional and linear.","The Weave consists of five vertical strands interwoven with five horizontal strands. Each strand is broken into two or three segments by cross-strands. The segments in turn consist of two or three spaces. A space located at the intersection of two strands is called a bridge. A space laterally adjacent to a Dungeon space is called a slope. The strands can be thought of as sine curves viewed from above. Bridges are located at the crests of each curve, and slopes connect bridges to the (hidden) troughs of the curve. An adjacent bridge and slope are continuous if located in the same strand. They are normal, i.e., perpendicular, if located in different strands. The Dungeon consists of sixteen black spaces called cells. Cells are considered adjacent if separated by a single Weave space.","There are two types of motion: sliding and stepping. Sliding consists of continuous motion along a smooth surface. Pieces slide when moving within the Dungeon or along a strand. A step occurs when a piece abruptly changes altitude by moving across an edge. Pieces step when moving between a normal bridge and slope, or between the Weave and the Dungeon.","A single move can combine sliding and stepping. An important example is \"stepping down from one segment to another,\" or \"segment stepping.\" This occurs when a piece, starting from any space in a segment, slides to the bridge of the segment (if not already there), steps down to a normal slope, and comes to rest on any space in the new segment. A piece that steps down from one segment to another must always step as part of the move. It cannot start and stop within the same segment.","All pieces capture by replacement. With the exception of the Circle, a piece cannot move across an occupied space. Pieces can, however, move underneath other pieces when taking an underpass or an implied cell.","To see how each individual piece moves, open the ReadMe file that comes with the game or right click on the piece.","Win by checkmating the opponent Star. Stalemate and repetition are a loss.","The bridge on which the Star begins the game is called its throne. A Star that steps off its throne is said to abdicate. It is imprisoned when it enters the Dungeon. In a typical game one or both Stars are forced into the Dungeon, from which they are helpless from checks delivered from the overhanging Weave. The Stars are quite mobile, however, and are often chased throughout the Dungeon before checkmate can be achieved.","Although a win is a win, Weave \u0026 Dungeon grades wins according to quality. A player that wins with his Star unmoved on its throne earns a Triumph, the highest level. A player that wins with his Star on the Weave earns an Ovation. If both Stars are in the Dungeon, the winning player earns a simple Victory.","Please send any comments or bug reports to dtroyka@justice.com."],"image":"game944_scr_Weave.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

It occurred to me that a chess-like game could be played on a board resembling that window; hence the idea for WINDOWS CHESS took root.","The board consists of forty-eight square cells and sixteen trapeze cells arranged in four concentric loops of sixteen cells each.  Another way to think of it is as a traditional board with eight ranks and eight files, with the files joined at each end - [a] and [h], [b] and [g], [c] and [f], and [d] and [e].  The joined files - the trapeze cells - are called the \"polar\" regions.  The game thus has much in common both with traditional FIDE chess and with the family of variants played on round or cylindrical boards.","At setup, the pieces occupy their traditional home cells and generally retain the movement properties familiar to players of FIDE Chess, albeit with some exceptions explained below.  There is one additional piece, the Conqueror, a Queen-Knight compound corresponding to the Amazon in some other varieties of Chess or to the Maharajah in MAHARAJAH AND THE SEPOYS.  The Conqueror is purely a promotion piece; on reaching the eighth rank, a Pawn is crowned as a Conqueror.","The sixteen \"polar\" cells (the trapezes) have a peculiar effect on the movements of the Knight and Bishop, and of the Queen and Conqueror.  I got this idea from the behaviour of a compass at the North and South Poles: it goes wild.  Every direction from the \"pinhead\" of the North Pole is SOUTH, so one's sense of direction gets distorted.  This gave me the idea of using the \"polar\" regions of the board to \"bend\" the paths of the Bishop and Knight.  Each polar trapeze acts like a pivot which swivels the Bishop's path, and the corner trapezes (d1, e1, d8, and e8) even allow the Bishop to migrate from cells of one colour to the other.  The Bishop is therefore no longer colourbound, and can occupy all 64 cells on the board.  The \"polar\" cells also bend the Knight's L-shaped path back upon itself, so that a Knight in the polar regions can sometimes move to or from an adjacent cell.  This works when moving to or from cells c1, d1, e1, f1, d2, or e2 on White's side, or c8, d8, e8, f8, d7, or e7 on Black's side.","I have decided to do away with Castling and En Passant captures.  I never liked the En Passant rule, while castling serves to protect the King and bring a Rook into play.  On a round board, the former is not so effective and the latter is superfluous, in my opinion.  I am willing to reconsider this in future releases if popular demand and/or playtesting with Zillions indicates it to be a desirable feature, however.","WINNING CONDITIONS","Win by checkmating the enemy King.  Stalemate and baring the King count as a qualified win - better than a draw but not as good as a checkmate.  Award a point for a checkmate or a royal conversion, a half-point for forcing a stalemate or baring the enemy King, and a half-point to both players in the event of a draw.","STILL CONFUSED?","Look in the DIAGRAMS folder (GIF format) for illustrations and detailed explanations about each piece's properties."],"image":"game2187_scr_WindowsChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

It Cannot capture Pawns or Ninja Pawns.","The Detonator -------------- Moves passively like queen or knight. Detonates all adjacent pieces except Ninja Pawns.   Detonation counts as a turn and it does NOT move when carrying out detonation.  Click on enemy piece surrounding detonator to activate the detonation.

You only have to click one enemy piece, the rest will be removed, but Zillions is picky on which order you click or it wont allow you to  remove the pieces.","The Flying Guillotine  ---------------------- Flying Guillotine moves like a Queen and captures by flying over enemy, and landing on empty square immediately beyond.  It also makes a special capture by replacement 2 squares away, and can also jump over an adjacent friendly piece.   If there is one enemy piece adjacent to it and another immediately after on same line, the Flying Guillotine takes out both pieces and lands 2 squares away. One Flying Guillotine can be dropped by a side into an empty space on the backrank.

When in enemy territory it can also capture 1 space sideways. It can move 1-multiple spaces toward the center and en-passant does not apply. From the middle it moves 1 space into enemy half of board after which it can move forward either 1 or 2 spaces forward.  Up to 5 Ninja Pawns can be dropped (1 per turn) to an empty space on the 2nd rank , and you can optionally make the forward thrust in the same move.

Updated May 10, 2003: several mods by L. Lynn Smith. Rabbit Elimination and Immobilization wins added by Tim O'Lena, June 2020. Translated into 3D by Tim O'Lena, June 2020.","See the 'Learn to Play' section on www.arimaa.com for an animated tutorial.","Objective There are three ways to win a game of Arimaa. The first player to get just one Rabbit across the board to a goal cell wins. On this 3D board, Gold's goals are 5a5-5e5; Silver's goals are 1a1-1e1.  Another way to win is to eliminate all of the opponent's Rabbits. In standard Arimaa, you win if you capture the opponent's last Rabbit, even if you sacrifice your own last Rabbit to do so. The third way to win is by immobilizing your opponent. Stalemate is a LOSS for the immobilized side.","Setup The game has no fixed starting position for the pieces.  The game starts","with an empty board.  First Gold sets down all the Gold pieces in any order on the four rows closes to Gold, on the bottom of the board. Silver then sets down all the Silver pieces on the four rows closest to Silvers side, on the top of the board.  Once the pieces have been set down the players take turns moving the pieces with Gold going first. Each player has 10 Rabbits, 3 Cats, 3 Dogs, 2 Horses, 1 Camel and 1 Elephant.","Steps On each turn the players can take up to 4 steps. All pieces move the same way, which","is laterally like a Rook in Hexagonal Chess. Except that Rabbits cannot move","backwards. So all pieces have up to six degrees of freedom, depending upon which space they occupy,  except Rabbits, which have only four degrees of freedom. (A Gold Rabbit may move Up, but not Down; North, but not South.) Moving a piece from its current space to an adjacent space counts as one step.  The 4 steps can be distributed across multiple pieces.  Thus a player can move one piece 4 steps, four pieces 1 step each, one piece 3 steps and another piece 1 step,  etc. The same piece may take steps in different directions. A player must change the configuration of the board on every turn - it is illegal to cancel your own moves out, resulting in no change to the position. The position must be different at the end of a players turn. You may pass up to three of your four moves if you like.","Pushing and Pulling A piece can push opponents weaker pieces to any adjacent space and","move into its place. This is called 'pushing' and uses up 2 steps; one for","pushing the opponents piece and one for moving into its space. Pushing must","be completed within a players turn and cannot be distributed across turns.  The Elephant is the strongest and can push any other piece except another Elephant. The Elephant is followed in strength by the Camel, then the Horse, Dog, Cat and","finally the Rabbit which is the weakest and cannot push any other piece.  Pieces","of equal strength cannot push each other. A piece can also pull opponents weaker pieces which are adjacent","into the space that it moved from.  This is called 'pulling' and uses up","2 steps; one for moving the piece and one for pulling the opponents piece. A piece cannot simultaneously push and pull. You may push or pull only one opposing piece at a time. But it is possible -and legal- to push and/or pull twice in the same turn, using the four available steps.","Example: Gold's Elephant on 1b1 moves to 1c1, pulling a Silver cat from 1a1 to 1b1. That uses two steps. In the next two steps, Gold moves the Elephant from 1c1 to 1c2, pushing a Rabbit from 1c2 to 1c3. In this example, Gold could also have chosen to pull the Cat twice, with the Cat ending on 1c1.","Freezing A piece that is alone and adjacent to an opponents stronger piece is","considered 'frozen' and cannot move. A piece is considered to be alone if","there are no friendly pieces adjacent to it. The lonely weaker piece","can be 'unfrozen' by moving any other friendly piece next to it. When no longer","alone the weaker piece is unfrozen and can immediately begin to move within","the same turn.","Traps The positions at 2b3, 2d3, 4b3 and 4d3 are called 'traps'. Any piece that is standing","on a trap is immediately removed from the board if there are no friendly pieces","adjacent to it. A piece may safely stand on or pass through a trap as long as there is","a friendly piece adjacent to it. If the friendly piece moves away then the lonely","piece on the trap is immediately removed from the board.","Notes about the Zillions implementation:","* To pass the move, click on the `change turns` button. * Use the 'Variety' slider under Play > Computer Opponent to get Zillions of Games to create varied starting set-ups."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

The hook-move can be found in some large Shogi variants.","This move is basically a translation by the piece along one vacant path then turning perpendicular.  So that a ROOK might slide forward along a file then either turn right, left, up or down.  It is not allowed to perform the hook-move from an occupied cell.","The hook-move in this game is bound to specific planes, those being the 8x8 planes of the levels, the 3x8 planes of the ranks and the 3x8 planes of the files.  Thus a BISHOP with its diagonal hook-move would not be allowed to leave the plane which it began this movement.  So that if the BISHOP started sliding toward the far right corner of the 8x8 plane of a level, it would not be permitted to make a diagonal move which resulted in it exiting that level. With the previous stated starting direction, the only diagonal hook-move it would be permitted would be to the near right corner or the far left of that particular level.","The reasoning behind the use of the hook-move in 3D Chess is to allow for few pieces to achieve the mate of an opposing KING.  This also allows the Rook to retain its power which it exercises in 2D by being able to completely dominate a plane and thus block the advancement of an opposing KING."],"image":"game1120_scr_3D_Hook-Move_Chess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

To throw the dice, click on the left die. One can make two moves in a row, or choose to pass one or both moves. To pass a move one must press the yellow marking on the right side of the board. A tone is then heard. The long die has four sides, showing 2, 3, 4, and 5. Its values are as follows: 2 = boat, 3 = knight, 4 = rook, 5 = king or pawn. You must pass manually if you don't own the piece anymore.","A player can not move his pieces after his own king is captured (the program will pass his moves automatically). However, should the partner capture an enemy king, then the immobilized party can re-introduce a king, and become mobile again. When this happens, a king appears to the right of the board. The immobilized player can introduce this king on an empty square anywhere on the board. In this case he has no second move, so he must pass the second move. Note that a king that has been captured twice cannot be introduced again.","Pawns promote to any of the four types: rook, knight, boat, or king. Piece-type is determined by the promotion square. For Yellow, the a-, and h-files are boat-files, as the boats' initial squares are on these files. Hence, Yellow promotes to boats on a8 and h8, knights on b8 and g8, rooks on c8 and f8, and kings on d8 and f8.","It is possible to capture one's partners pieces. However, in this implementation, capture of the partner's king is prohibited (that would be unethical!). The engine will in most cases avoid capturing his partner's pieces."],"image":"game1191_scr_4-handedChaturanga.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,14],"variations":2}

Troyka","description":["6D Chess is the final installment in the nD Chess series, which began with 3D Chess, 4D Chess, and 5D Chess. These games take chess from the regular 2D environment to boards of successively higher dimensions. This is accomplished, in essence, by adding one orthogonal axis per dimension.  The rules of standard chess apply, subject to the following:","6D Chess is played on a 2x2x2x2x2x2 board. Each of the eight 2x2x2 cubic sub-boards is connected to its three neighbors (4-east or 4-west, 5-up or 5-down, 6-east or 6-west) such that each space in a sub-board is orthogonally adjacent to its counterparts in the neighboring boards. These three connections, along with the three within any 2x2x2 cube, give each space six orthogonally adjacent neighbors. The board is perfectly symmetric along all six axes.","Diagonal motion of the Queen and Bishop takes place in any plane defined by two of the board's six axes (i.e., they do not move \"triagonally,\" \"quadragonally,\" etc.). In other words, a diagonal step consists of two orthogonal steps, each along a different axis.","The King moves only orthogonally.","The Knight has a non-capturing and a capturing move. When not capturing, it moves one step triagonally (i.e., to a space three orthogonal steps away, with each step along a different axis). When capturing, it moves one step orthogonally.","Pawns move one orthogonal step in the direction of the opponent's King row (up, 4-east, 5-up, or 6-west for White), capture as they move (i.e., no diagonal captures), and promote on the opponent's King row.","No castling, en passant, or two-step Pawn moves, and stalemate is a loss. In the variant, Pawns can capture enemy Pawns along any diagonal. This rule allows for Pawn interaction which does not exist in the principal game because the Pawns are on inverted rows.  The nD Chess series attempts to preserve as much from standard chess as is possible through the translation to higher dimensions. The boards in each variant contain 64 squares, starting with 4x4x4 in the 3D version, and progressing to 4x4x2x2, 4x2x2x2x2, and 2x2x2x2x2 in the 6D variant. Each game begins with the regular complement of 32 pieces which retain, as far as practicable, their move definitions. The Rook in all four games slides along an orthogonal and the Bishop along a diagonal. The Queen combines the powers of the Rook and Bishop. The Knight in the 3D, 4D, and 5D versions moves in the familiar fashion by taking two steps in a line followed by a perpendicular step.  The principal differences from regular chess motion lay in the King, Pawns, and 6D Knight. The King is confined to orthogonal motion in the 5D and 6D versions (and in the variants of the 3D and 4D games) because otherwise its mobility leads to frequent draws. The Pawns in each game move one orthogonal step in the direction of the opponent's King row and promote upon reaching that row, a natural definition which was adopted in Raumschach. In the 3D and 4D versions they capture, as might be expected, to either side of a square to which they could move. In the 5D and 6D games they capture as they move; otherwise they are too powerful. The 6D Knight has a unique definition because the regular Knight's move is impossible (there are no dimensions of the required three units in length). Finally, castling, en passant, and the Pawn double step, which serve no purpose in these games, have been eliminated.  Believe it or not, this is not the first attempt at a 6D version of chess. For a description of previous efforts, check out the History section that comes with the game.  For another 4D chess variant, try Chesseract. For other hypergames, there's Hyperspace, Skava, Superstring, Wormhole, and Tessa."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,28],"variations":2}
