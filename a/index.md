# Notable Game Artists and Game Authors

Artists are credited with providing the art featured in the game (either on the
game board, on game equipment or on the box of the game).  Before the 1990s
it was rare for the artist, or even the game designer, to be credited for their
work, so this list is unfortunately incomplete for classsic (and older) games.

The game art significantly contributes to the look and feel of a game and can
set the mood, illustrate story elements, make the game more inviting and add
a sense of visual consistency.  With some games, such as Collectible Card Games
(CCGs) the art is a prominent aspect despite having no influence over the game
controls and game mechanisms.
