Arrangement Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the king + queen and another piece except the rooks. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the kings thus have been swapped, Black can now relocate the queen, if he so wishes. Next White relocates his queen and immediately starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules derive from Fischer Random Chess. White castles in the following way (the Black procedure is equivalent). When castling left (O-O-O) , the king moves to c1 and the rook moves to d1. When castling right (O-O) the king moves to g1 and the rook moves to f1. The following conditions must be true: the king must not move to, from or over an attacked square; the king and rook have never moved; there is no other piece on any square over which the king and rook move.","Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","Curtailed castling: in an alternative variant, if the king is positioned on the g or b file, castling is restricted to the side on which the king is positioned. The variant could be useful to enhance strategical predictability."],"image":"game1707_scr_ArrangementChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":8}

In the beginning the bishop is clearly weaker than a knight, but can in later situations be more valuable than a knight.

Unlike Fusion Chessgi, which is a straightforward hybrid of these two games, Assimilation Chess slightly changes the rules of Fusion Chess to create a game in which you can add to your own material by capturing enemy pieces. Instead of holding onto a captured piece for future deployment, you assimilate the captured piece into the capturing piece whenever the two pieces are non-identical simple pieces. For example, a Knight that captures a Rook becomes a Marshall, or a Rook that captures a Bishop becomes a Queen. When a simple piece captures a Pawn or a compound piece, or when a Pawn or compound piece captures anything, the capture does not change the capturing piece.  The game's name is inspired by the Borg from Star Trek, who regularly increase their numbers by assimilating their enemies. The object is the same as it is for Fusion Chess, to checkmate your opponent's current royal piece.  The board was made from computer generated textures.

You start with a King, eight pawns, and seven Quantum pieces, which are undefined, potential, pieces that, when they are put into use, must be defined as either Queen, Rook, Bishop or Knight. On your turn you can either move a regular piece with the usual chess rules or move one of your Quantum-pieces, which is at that moment transformed to a normal piece of your choice, provided that a piece of that type exists in the reserve.","When the pieces of one player have all been employed and there are only regular pieces of his colour on the board, then it's time to do a recycle. In this situation piece movement is prohibited and the only thing you can do is pressing the red button beside the board. This will cause all pieces on the board (except kings and pawns) to be substituted with Quantum pieces. The pieces on the board will be transferred to the reserve. The cycle now begins anew, and it's now possible to drop the pieces again. Also the other player must acknowledge the recycle by also pressing the red button. When, for one player, only pieces of one type (not counting kings and pawns) remain on the board, recycles will cease. However, if the transition to this state occurs simultaneously with transition to a recycle state, then the latter will take precedence. This glitch (?) might be fixed in a later version. The reason for the \"one-type\" rule is that the player with only one type of piece should not be of disadvantage, as his Quantums would be foreseeable. And, of course, if recycle didn't cease it wouldn't be possible to win with queen against lonely king.","If one party has made the mistake of initializing recycle when his king will be exposed to capture after recycle, one cannot press the red button, but will instead lose the game. This is acknowledged by moving the king off the board, which is similar to the old practice of felling the king when the situation is hopeless. Thus, the king cannot actually be captured. The program will sometimes give up if he will be checkmated after recycle.","Bario uses a special rule for Quantum capture. The program chooses a piece to be removed from the reserve and places it in the corner of the reserve. If you are happy with the choice then just play on. However, if you'd prefer to lose another piece then you must bring back the corner piece to your reserve by capturing another piece of yours which you would rather have removed. The opponent must acknowledge this procedure by pressing the red button.","Castling is possible with a Quantum on the corner square instead of a rook. It turns into a rook while castling.","Note that a Quantum can give check, too, provided that there exist pieces in the reserve that can threaten the enemy king. This means that the king must take measures immediately, just like it was a threat from a regular piece. This will feel unusual to the regular chessplayer."],"image":"game1179_scr_Bario.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

Normal chess rules apply. Instead of the regular pieces in the initial position, there exist \"shaman\" pieces (residing in a \"spiritual trance-state\"), that can travel directly to any empty square on the board. Alternatively, the shaman can directly be transformed to a piece from the regular piece set. Only the pawns and the kings are initially defined. Until the shaman has been defined as a real piece it cannot interact with other pieces, that is, cannot make captures. In order to transform a shaman (allow a shaman to leave the shamanic state and become a normal piece) the player must use up a move on the spot. You transform a shaman by pressing on the piece. A shaman can transform himself to any piece there remains to drop. The shaman is only mobile once. Hence it becomes immobile on the square where it has landed. So the only option is, later, to transform it to a normal piece. A mark on the shaman signals that !","it has  used up its move.","Castling is allowed with a shaman instead of a rook.

After having jumped any piece, the Basilisk cannon can slide and capture like a queen. However, if no jump move exists it's allowable to slide like a queen, but without capturing.","Enemy pawns, however, can restrict its movement. The Basilisk can only reach the square immediately behind the enemy pawn, regardless of direction. By example, if the black king is checked on the g-file, it can defend itself by moving the pawn forward. While its tactical capacity is truncated the Basilisk can harmonize with the positional qualities of the game. Positioned two or more steps behind a friendly pawn, it can threaten an enemy Basilisk, which cannot threaten back. This is an important positional aspect. The Basilisk has about the same value as bishop + pawn (preliminary estimate).","Before starting, the players must decide whether they want to use the extra piece. To make a decision, press on the little black square. Only if both players choose not to use the extra piece, then it becomes a regular game of chess. If white turns down the extra piece, then black can overrule this.","If players have elected to include external pieces, they may either move a piece or pawn, or drop the extra piece from the reserve. Pieces may only be dropped on the first rank, on an empty square behind a friendly pawn. The friendly pawn is immediately relocated one square ahead, to a position which must be empty. If these conditions aren't satisfied then the piece cannot be dropped. Should a player refrain from inserting his extra piece at these occasions, then he has forfeited his chance of introducing it.

Instead the Belfry, when it moves, has the power to sling a piece located behind itself to a forward square in the alignment direction. The slung piece, which can be of any colour, is the nearest piece in the opposite direction of the move. This piece is hurled to the square immediately forward of the square on which the Belfry stops. Any enemy piece positioned here is captured. Thus the Belfry can be used for transporting friendly pieces, attacking enemy pieces, or removing enemy pieces from good positions. In opening and middlegame the Belfry introduces new tactical themes. If it remains on the first rank it can transport the rooks and the king very effectively along the first rank. In the endgame it can transport friendly pawns and the friendly king over the board. It can open files for the rooks, by removing a friendly pawn sideways. Pawns can be catapulted to their promotion square, when they are promoted to queen as only alternative. Pawns cannot be catapulted to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit.

Because                 of the enhanced size of the Big Battle Board, the Big Battle counterpart                 of the Chess Pawn, called a Soldier ( Sol for short) has                 the option of moving three squares, two squares or one square forward.                 Unlike the Chess pawn the Big Battle Soldier has these options not                 only on its first move but throughout the game. The en-passant rules                 of Big Battle allow capture by en-passant whenever an enemy Soldier                 on an adjacent file attempts to sneak past by moving two or three                 squares.  The other big difference seen in Big Battle consists                 of a new and powerful piece called the Prince. The Prince                 combines the power of the Chess Knight and the Big Battle Queen.                 But the Big Battle Queen itself has greater powers than the                 Chess Queen. In addition to the traditional powers of the Chess                 Queen the Big Battle Queen can jump over an immediately adjacent                 piece (but cannot move like a Knight). The Big Battle King                 has the ability to move two squares. He also, can jump over an immediately                 adjacent piece. The Big Battle Knight has the option, while                 positioned on its back rank of making a double Knight move, known                 as the double Knight hop, providing that no piece occupies the intermediate                 square of this manoeuvre. The Big Battle Bishop moves exactly                 the same way as the Chess Bishop. Off course the enhanced Big Battle                 chequer board gives it more squares to move to. All Big Battle pieces,                 except for the Bishop, have greater powers than the corresponding                 traditional Chess piece.

The bishop moves on the diagonals like a regular bishop, but it can also move one square forward, provided that this square is empty. The bolyar (which means \"royal knight\"), initially positioned on either side of the king, moves like a queen, but can only capture on the orthogonals (that is, capture is not allowed when moving diagonally). The boat, initially positioned on the extra corner squares, can move maximally two squares, orthogonally, diagonally, or like a knight.

It can make a capture by performing a move in two legs, by changing from orthogonal to diagonal. Thus to capture it bounces diagonally on a piece of any colour positioned to the side of the orthogonal, and lands on an enemy piece somewhere on the diagonal, provided that any intermediate squares are empty. The capture move is performed in the prolonged movement direction only (two direction alternatives). While the Buccaneer slides along an orthogonal, several diagonals (in the prolonged movement direction) could be chosen, provided that there exist screens for bouncing.

Bughouse has four players playing in turn on two chess boards simultaneously, generally working together as two teams against each other. Pieces captured by a player are passed on to his team partner, who can then drop these captured pieces on an unoccupied square on his board in lieu of a normal move (just as in the two-player game Crazyhouse). Note that pawns may not be placed on the first and last rank, and promoted pawns revert back to pawns when captured. To drop a piece, just click on a captured piece stored outside the boards. A player (or a team) wins by capturing one of the opponents' kings.  Bughouse Chess is a quick and exciting game, especially when played with human opponents and partners. It is especially popular on internet chess servers like www.freechess.org. It is normally played with chess clocks over the board or on the internet. Each player usually has three or five minutes of time, sometimes using time to `sit' while waiting for their partner to capture pieces that they need. This Zillions implementation is a turn based variant of bughouse for both two players and four players, with the following variations:  Variant 1: Single Move Order1. Board 1: (white) played by BluePlayer2. Board 2: (white) played by OrangePartner3. Board 2: (black) played by BluePartner4. Board 1: (black) played by OrangePlayer...and so on  Variant 2: Double Move Order1. Board 1: (white) played by BluePlayer2. Board 1: (black) played by OrangePlayer3. Board 2: (white) played by OrangePartner4. Board 2: (black) played by BluePartner...and so on  Variant 2 is derived from a turn based email version of bughouse, and differs only in the order of turns.Variants 3 and 4 feature permanent pawn promotion, where promoted pawns do not revert back to pawns when captured, unlike in official bughouse.

It is a descendant of Indian Chaturanga and is believed to be quite old. The pieces are red and black and are usually carved. The red pawns are carved as demonic men, the black as monkeys, in reference to the battle of the demons versus the god Rãma and Hanuman's monkeys.","The objective is checkmate. The king, rook (chariot), and knight (horse), move as in orthodox chess. The pawns also move as in orthodox chess, but have no initial double move. The General (equivalent: queen) moves one step diagonally in all directions. The Elephant (equivalent: bishop) moves one step diagonally in all directions, or one step forwards. Pawns promote to General only, and only if the General is missing from the board. Pawn promotion occurs only on the marked squares on the enemy side of the board. Promotion occurs not immediately, but when the pawn leaves the square. Note! When leaving the square, a pawn is not allowed to promote if that implies capturing an enemy King or General. A pawn can also promote on the spot, that is, promote without moving (just lift and drop the pawn). It is possible for a pawn to move past the squares where he can promote: in that case, promotion is no longer possible for that pawn.","In the first phase the pieces are dropped on the board, either behind the pawn chain, or on a friendly pawn. In the latter case the removed friendly pawn must immediately be relocated to another empty position. This implementation honours the rule that the rooks must be dropped on the first rank, which is reserved for the rooks only. After all the pieces have been dropped the play begins. Stalemate is not allowed in Burmese Chess. Should you put the opponent in a stalemate position, you must take the move back.","Don't underestimate the curiously moving Elephant, although it is slow. It is very suitable for giving mate. Together with a king, or some other piece, it can often give mate in the endgame. Knights and bishops can seldom achieve this. The Elephant has about the same value as a knight. Passed pawns are much less dangerous in Burmese Chess than in orthodox chess. Play aggressively with the General, because when it is exchanged, you can promote a pawn a get a new one.","The additional drop variants differ only regarding the promotion rules. Pawns can promote upon entering a marked square. The 8 standard positions given as variants derive from the Burmese Chess Guide 'Myan-ma sit bayin lan-nyunt sa-ok gyi', as cited in D.B. Pritchard's The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants.","Note! According to the standard rules of the Burmese Chess Federation, pieces are always dropped behind the pawn chain and Red drops all his pieces first.

The board is 8x10. Two new pieces are introduced (1) Archbishop (Princess/Cardinal) which slides like a Bishop or leaps like a Knight (2) Chancellor (Empress/Marshall) which slides like a Rook or leaps like a Knight. Castling is performed by jumping three squares with the King instead of two. Other rules are similar to ordinary chess. Piece setup: RNABQKBCNR","Capablanca Relocation Chess is like Capablanca Chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the king/queen and another piece except the rooks. Thus, if the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. If the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour. Note that black begins by making the initial swap. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then has the option to relocate his king or queen, whereupon he starts the game by making the first move. Each player can choose between 12 different setups, which results in 144 different board positions.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules are simple and derive from Chess960. King and rook end up on their usual squares. The only difference is that the king can make longer (or shorter, or none at all) leaps than usual. All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened and neither of the pieces must have moved before. Castle on the queenside is denoted O-O-O.

The board is 8x10. Two new pieces are introduced (1) Archbishop (Princess/Cardinal) which slides like a Bishop or leaps like a Knight (2) Chancellor (Empress/Marshall) which slides like a Rook or leaps like a Knight. Castling is performed by jumping three squares with the King instead of two. Other rules are similar to ordinary chess. Piece setup: RNABQKBCNR","The following variants use the same pieces and board as Capablanca's chess.","Bird's Chess was invented by the chess master Henry Bird in 1874. It is very similar to Capablanca's Chess and is probably the inspirational source of the latter. Piece setup: RNBCQKABNR","Carrera's Chess was invented by Pietro Carrera in the 17th century. He wrote a long book on chess, called Il Gioco delgi Scacchi, and published it in 1617 in Miltello in Sicily. This is the precursor of both Bird's Chess and Capablanca's Chess. In the original rules there was no castle move, and a somewhat curious rule involving 'en passant'. This implementation introduces castling and regular 'en passant' rules. Piece setup: RCNBKQBNAR","Teutonic Chess is a variant of Capablanca's Chess, using a different setup, conceived by undersigned. It might seem superfluous to give it a new proper name when it is only a rearrangement of the initial position, but this is what people do. \"Gothic Chess\" (RNBQCKABNR) is a US patented version of Capablanca's Chess, the only difference being the initial setup. If you interchange Chancellor and Archbishop in Teutonic Chess you will get Gothic Chess. Piece setup for Teutonic Chess: RNBQAKCBNR","Another variant is Embassy Chess. It is too a variant of Capablanca's Chess, but the setup is different and the short castle is performed on the queenside. It was Kevin Hill that came up with this idea. Piece setup: RNBQKCABNR","A variant which has received some attention among professional chessplayers, including Korchnoi, is Janus Chess. It was invented by W. Schoendorf, 1990. In this variant the Chancellor is replaced by an extra Archbishop (also called Janus), and the short castle is performed on the queenside, when the king jumps three squares. When castling long the king jumps four squares. Piece setup: RANBKQBNAR","Schoolbook Chess is a variant invented by S. Trenholme. In this variant the king may castle two or three squares towards the rook on the right hand side, and two, three, or four squares towards the rook on the left hand side. The rook leaps over the king to land beside the king. Piece setup: RQNBAKBNCR"],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,34],"variations":14}

Detonates all adjacent pieces except Ninja Pawns.   Detonation counts as a turn and it does NOT move when carrying out detonation.","Click on enemy piece surrounding detonator to activate the detonation.   If there are multiple pieces to detonate start by clicking on the enemy pieces in this this order: n, s, e, w , ne, nw.

Freezes all adjacent pieces. Frozen pieces cannot move nor capture nor check a king, and can be unfrozen only if the Terror Freeze is captured or moved away.","The Ninja Pawns:  ---------------- This special pawn can move/capture like a regular pawn as well as move 1 space sideways. When in enemy territory it can also capture 1 space sideways. It can move 1-multiple spaces toward the center and en-passant does not apply.

Flexible Castling - The king can castle by moving 1 to 4 squares towards rook. The rook always ends up next to the king on the other side as in standard chess.  The choice of castling depends on whether it is more desirable to immediately  have the rook in the center file or the king tucked away at the wing.","When carrying out 1 step castling, Zillions pops up a box asking to choose a move.  The second move indicating kings move AND the rook to move to king square is the castling move.","2.

(Although, it may run on version 1.0, which I have not been able to test.)","Castle Siege Chess merges three 20-space circular bands (similar to those used in Byzantine Chess) with a 6x6 rectangular area of spaces into the middle of the inner ring of spaces. This board, dubbed the CirSquare 96, provides 3 directions of attack (frontal and two sides) on the opponents castle. The 96 squares are exactly 50% more than traditional chess and there are 50% more pieces--4 more pawns, 2 Archers, and 2 Catapults. The are 4 rows of spaces (12 spaces wide) between the two opponents' castles.","The standard chess pieces move the same as they do in traditional chess. The Archer and Catapult have very simple moves. The Archer compliments the Bishop and Knight, and the Catapult compliments the Rook and the Knight.","Archer - moves 1, 2, or 3 spaces across corners. It can jump over 1 or 2 pieces across corners. It only captures on the second space.","Catapult - moves 1, 2, or 3 spaces across sides. It can jump over 1 or 2 pieces across sides. It only captures on the second space.","There are only a few more rules than traditional chess:","The long range pieces (Queen, Rook, and Bishop) can only cross 2 castle walls on 1 move.","When a King is in check, it cannot cross a castle wall to move out of check. This allows the King to be cornered on a round board.","Pawns promote when they cross the opponent's castle wall onto Pawn row. This is one row sooner than in traditional chess.","Castling and En Passant are not used because I could not figure out how to script them on the unique CirSquare 96 board.","Moving through the 4 triangular shaped spaces: since there are no opposite corners or sides in a triangle, a piece moving into a triangle across corners (such as a Bishop) can exit the triangle from either of the other 2 corners, and a piece moving into a triangle across a side (such a Rook) can exit the triangle across either of the other 2 sides. This provides for some unusual moves through the triangular spaces.","Other than these few simple rule differences, Castle Siege Chess plays like traditional chess, but the new pieces, more directions of attack, earlier Pawn promotion, and unusual moves through the triangles make the game more interesting and exciting.","Note: If the game does not fit on your computer screen, increase the screen resolution for your computer to at least 1024x768 for the 800 pixel game.","I hope that you enjoy both the standard version (variant 1) of Castle Siege Chess and all of its other variants.","Since Zillions of Games shows you all the legal moves for a piece when you click on it, there is really no need for additional directions.

Cavalier                 Chess uses different pieces than Chess, but each piece starts off                 in the same place as its counterpart in Chess. In Cavalier Chess,                 the Knight King (K+N) replaces the King, the Marshall (R+N) replaces                 the Rook, the Paladin (B+N) replaces the Bishop, the Nightrider                 (multiple N moves) replaces the Knight, and the Cavalier (XiangQi                 N) replaces the Pawn. The Queen is the same as in Chess. Unlike                 standard Chess, there is no castling. When a Cavalier reaches the                 eighth rank, it promotes to the piece whose starting square it lands                 on. A Cavalier cannot promote to a Knight King, and if it lands                 on the Knight King's starting square, it promotes to another superior                 piece of the player's choosing.

The way the pieces are placed in the opening setup allows the players to follow practical all the openings used for usual chess. The new pieces (Cannon, Elephant) are inspired from Xiangqi (Chinese Chess), with the intention to bring back together the two branches of the game that went from India and Persia either east to China, and west to the Arabs and then to Europe. Shako is presented in the French book \"Guide des Echecs exotiques et insolites\". Invented in 1990. The name Shako means Chess in Esperanto,'another kind of non-conformism and utopia'.","Tamerlane 2000 Played over a 11x11 board with 56 pieces. This game is a variant of Timur's Chess (or Tamerlane Chess). Victory is obtained when opposite King is checkmated with no more possibility of replacement by a Prince. With this implementation, the game is won when the enemy King is checkmated. This is the first chessvariant invented by Jean-Louis Cazaux. Based on Tamerlane II, a game invented in 1978, revised several times and renamed Tamerlane 2000 to mark the difference. A variant proposed here is Wild Tamerlane played with strong pieces (Queens, Gryphons) since the beginning of the game.","Perfect 12 Played over a 12x12 board with 72 pieces. For the Ancients, 12 was a perfect number. Much more than 10, since it can be divided by 2, 3 and 4. This game is a chess variant on a 12 x 12 board with 12 types of different pieces. A tentative to a well balanced game since there is the same number of Pawns than other pieces. The driving idea was to gather characters from most famous chess variations, historic and regional. Along the traditional Chess pieces, it has the Cannon from Xiang-Qi, the Lion from Chu Shogi, the Camel from Tamerlane Chess, the Gryphon from Spanish Grande Acedrex and the Prince from Courier Chess. The Elephant is a modern variation of medieval Alfil, also found in Shako. There are as many riders (Queen, Rook, Bishop and Gryphon) than leapers (Knight, Camel, Elephant and Lion). The piece density is 0.5 as for FIDE chess.","Gigachess Played over a 14x14 board with 96 pieces. This game is a very large chess variant on a 14 x 14 board with 20 types of different pieces coming from several famous chess variants. The piece density is almost 0.5 as for FIDE chess. This game is so far the biggest of the family. Amazon is the strongest piece, followed by the Queen then the Gryphon. Corporals are stronger than Pawns. Other popular games are given here and can be played using the same graphics.","Deciomega Deciomega Chess is a variant of Omega Chess. It is played on a regular 10x10 board. The two new piece types, Champion and Wizard, are both able to jump. Usual chess rules apply. Proposed (1999) by Jean-Louis Cazaux from Omega Chess. The same file allows to play the genuine Omega Chess invented by Daniel C. Macdonald.","Decimal Oriental Chess Invented by Vernon Rylands Parton, 1897-1974, a very active Chess variant inventor (Alice Chess, Rettah Chess, etc.). Parton included this variant in his booklet 100 Squares Chess + Damante published in 1972. For the game of Decimal Oriental the player has an army of twenty men which consist of two Chariots, two Cannons, two Horsemen, two Camels and two Elephants, with the Minister and Prince Commander, supported by eight soldiers.","Wildebeest Chess In his very nice book New Rules for Classic Games, R. Wayne Schmittberger gives the rules and backgrounds of his large chess variant Wildebeest Chess. One of the design purposes of this variant was to balance the number of riders (pieces like Rook and Bishop) and leapers (pieces like the Knight). e-mail: jl.cazaux@netcourrier.com web page (another view on Chess) : http://www.chez.com/cazaux/"],"image":"game157_scr_Shako.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":10}

These added squares modify drammatically the standard finals theory and minimum material needed for mating. i.e = Lonely Rook now is not sufficient if the opposite king safely reaches corner squares; in the contrary two knights, now taking advantages of corner squares, can force mate !","2 more pieces: The Prince: Moves like a king. Can cover up to 8 squares and it's valued 3 pawns. Its power is maximum when used in defensive tasks particularly for protecting its own king. In the downside, its slow moving and quite far position at the start force it to move outside later. Like all the standard pieces except for the Knights, Prince must wait the development of the nearby Rook (usually by castling) before going into action. In a second variant called \"Flanking Bishops\" it can develop easily.  The Master: Combines the moves of knight and a king. Can cover up to 20 squares, and great range of forks as it's still a leaper. Excellent for both attack and defense, this piece (valued about 7 pawns) stands in power between the Queen and the Rook; but it's actually the best piece can be promoted to, by a pawn. In the middle game his power equals even the Queen. In a second variant called \"Flanking Bishops\" can be rapidly developed. The new setup has been created looking at innovative \"Omega Chess\", in particular the 4 corner squares that give the possibility to insert 2 new pieces for each side leaving the same armony in disposition of the chessboard.

I found designing this 32-cell variant very challenging, but also rewarding.  I was able to adapt some pieces from FIDE chess to the geometry of the soccer ball (namely the Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn), and also invented a few new pieces specifically for this game (namely the Wizard, Satellite, Ringmaster, and Guard, along with the \"hidden\" and \"royal\" versions of those pieces).  I borrowed some ideas from Hexagonal Chess, Circular Chess, and even Klinzha to create this game.","In the initial setup, all of the pieces have Pawns or Guards on top of them.  The Pawns or Guards must move off before the pieces can move. You can do that by clicking on the cell where you want the Pawn or Guard to move.  You *cannot* move a piece until the Pawn or Guard on top of it has moved off first.","One challenge was to represent the three-dimensional soccer ball on a two-dimensional surface.  Borrowing a line from cartography, I settled on an AZIMUTHAL PROJECTION centred on a \"pole\", with distortion of distances further from the pole.  In simple terms, this meant centring the ball on Pentagon A, cutting it open, flattening it out, and expanding all the cells around A.  It's not very cosmetic, but it does the trick.  If anybody with better graphic skills than mine wishes to improve the look of the board, please do so!","The King begins the game off-board.  The first move of the game is to \"crown\" on of your other pieces, making it royal.  In the Zillions of Games implementation, do that by clicking on the King (who occupies a dummy-cell off-board) and moving it on top of the piece of your choice.","PIECES","Brief descriptions of each piece follow.  The \"Images\" folder bundled with the ZIP file includes graphics demonstrating the movements.","KING - this piece is inspired by the Goal in Klinzha.  The King, who begins the game off- board, has no movement powers of his own (except on the first move of the game) and must be carried by another piece.  The first move of the game is, therefore, to move the King on top of the piece that will carry him.  The Zillions version treats the King and the piece carrying him as a single piece.  The ROYAL ROOK, ROYAL BISHOP, ROYAL KNIGHT, ROYAL RINGMASTER, ROYAL SATELLITE, and ROYAL WIZARD are the resulting pieces.  Each royal piece retains the movement capabilities of its simple form, but may not move into or through check.","ROOK - rides any number of cell along a straight path between two pentagons.","BISHOP - rides in diagonal loops - defined as hexagonal cells connected by a line between two other cells.  Players of many hexagonal chess variants will recognize this piece.","WIZARD - rides in pentagonal loops - defined as pentagonal cells connected by a line between two hexagonal cells.  The Wizard moves on pentagons much as the Bishop does on hexagons, and was inspired by the hexagonal bishop.","KNIGHT - leaps (a) from one hexagon to another hexagon three cells away, (b) from a hexagon to a pentagon three cells away, or (c) from a pentagon to a hexagon three cells away.","RINGMASTER - rides in hexagonal loops around a single pentagon.  As each hexagon is adjacent to three pentagons, a Ringmaster may move in any one of three directions.","SATELLITE - rides in crooked hexagonal loops around \"equators\", i.e., paths that divide the board equally in two.  Each \"equator\" consists of ten hexagons and has five hexagons and six pentagons on either side of it.","PAWN - moves one cell without capturing on hexagons, or captures by moving one cell from a hexagon to a pentagon, on which it morphs into a Guard.  The Pawn, unlike its FIDE counterpart, may move backward or sideways as well as forwards. At the beginning of the game, every Pawn stands on top of another piece and must move off before that piece can move.  The Pawn may not attack a royal piece (i.e., a piece carrying the King).","GUARD - moves one cell without capturing on pentagons, or captures by moving one cell from a pentagon to a hexagon, on which it morphs into a Guard.   At the beginning of the game, the Guard stands on top of the Wizard, and must move off before the Wizard can move.  The Guard may not attack a royal piece (i.e., a piece carrying the King).","HIDDEN PIECES - pieces with Pawns or Guards on top of them, and are paralyzer until the Pawn or Guard moves off.  NOTE : if you are playing Zillions, the yellow and red pieces in the initial setup are really white and black pieces, respectively, with Pawns or Guards on them.  When the Pawn or Guard moves off, the piece left behind will change colour.","ROYAL PIECES - ordinary pieces that are carrying a King.  In Zillions, when the King mounts a piece, a crown appears above it.","HOW TO PLAY","The game begins by moving the King on top of the piece that will carry him.  Any piece in the initial setup may be chosen.","Next, start moving Pawns and Guards off pieces.  In the Zillions implementation, you will get an error message if you try to move a piece with a Pawn or Guard on top of it - \"Sorry, that piece cannot move now.\"  Choose a piece, and click your mouse on the cell where you want the Pawn or Guard to move.

This rainbow conditions count even higher than the normal 'checkmating': If in the same moment Player A is checkmated and Player B has no piece on say a yellow square then Player B has lost. Independently of this priority setting most games are decided by a rainbow condition. The drawing quota in \"Chess on the Rainbows\" is extremely low.  After some piece exchanges it really becomes difficult to keep all colors 'occupied'. So, if you can sacrifice a minor piece for three pawns you typically should try it, because 'three pieces less' means that the opponent will have increased problems to find occupants for all the board colors.

The method generates 9 different positions, all non-mirrored (except the standard position). The players in turn swap either the king or queen. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. The king can only swap with the queen bishop and the queen can only swap with the king bishop.","Black begins by swapping either his king or queen. Alternatively he can forgo this possibility (by pressing the king). When White has made his king or queen swap (or dispensed with this possibility) he immediately starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules are simple and derive from Chess960. King and rook end up on their usual squares. The only difference is that the king can make longer leaps than usual (or shorter, or none at all). All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened. NOTE! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c-file), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","With these relocation rules the rooks remain in their natural positions, and the bishops are always positioned so that there is still a choice to develop them on either of the kingside or queenside. The knights are ready to immediately attack in the centre. This maintains the strategical ambiguity of the initial position. Non-mirrored positions ensure that there exists a strategical tension, which makes games interesting. Black relocates first. White should command the game, and in this way he can take command of the strategical situation. Remember that the resultant castling positions are always the same as in standard chess.","Chess-9 (also Nonary Chess) is designed to overcome the problem of opening monotony. The mirrored Chess960 (FRC) positions have one major drawback, namely that they tend to be lacking in strategical variety, and many times it can be hard for White to claim the initiative, strategically or tactically. It is easier to find strategically interesting positions if we go outside FRC and investigate non-mirrored positions. If we keep the criterion that the king must be placed between the rooks, then Chess960 castling rules can be retained. For instance, if the kings are initially placed on different wings, then there is already a strategical tension (even though the king can castle on both wings). The good thing is that pieces end up on non-mirrored natural positions, bishops can be developed to either wing, the knights can immediately attack in the centre, and the king is placed between the rooks. Balanced non-mirrored positions might actually be a better idea than mirrored ones.","This method of regroupment in the initial array can be used instead of randomization (cmp. Fischer Random Chess). Thus it answers to the chessplayer's predilection for remaining in control. A famous regroupment occurred in the battle between Julius Caesar and Gnaeus Pompeius, where Caesar regrouped behind his lines. The maneuver was essential as he could counter the cavalry attack on the right flank, and this was also how he won the battle."],"image":"game1825_scr_Chess-9.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":2}

Like checkers, both sides begin play with 12 pieces situated on the 12 dark squares closest to them; only the dark squares are used for play; and black moves first.  Like chess the pieces capture by occupying the enemy's square rather than by jumping and the game is won by checkmating the opposing King.","Other than being confined to the dark squares all pieces (not pawns) move the same as in chess: Bishops move any number of squares diagonally; Rooks move any number of squares vertically or horizontally to another dark square; the Queen combines the abilities of the Rook and Bishop; the King can move to any adjacent dark square or castle with the Rook. As in checkers the Pawns move only diagonally forward and promote on the back rank but, as in chess, they may promote to any piece other than a King. When castling the King moves one dark square towards the Rook and the Rook leaps to the square the King left.","Since Rooks have no method of moving diagonally they are confined to only half of the dark squares.  To make this easier to visualize Chessers uses a special double-checker board which makes half of the dark squares blue and the other half green.  If this is found to be annoying, distracting or otherwise unhelpful it may be removed in the future.","Chessers includes a second piece set which uses checkers pieces for the King and Pawns which may be preferable for 'Pawns Only' and 'Pure' variants.","This game is young and may see minor changes in the future.","Game and rules file are Copyright 2002 Harvey Patterson.

It has been reinvented many times, and Ralph Betza is responsible for naming it Chessgi. It is basically Chess with the addition of drops from Shogi. Whenever you capture a piece, you replace it with the same piece of your own color, and you hold it in hand with the option to drop it on a subsequent turn. If you have any pieces in hand, you may use your turn to drop a piece on an empty square. This counts as your full turn. You may not move a piece and drop a piece on the same turn. Any Pawn on the second rank has the option of a double move. Although Chessgi is intended as a hybrid of Chess and Shogi, the rules of Chessgi differ from Shogi in some notable respects. Promoted pieces remain promoted when captured. They do not demote back to Pawns. Pawn drops are less restricted than in Shogi. Pawns may be dropped on any empty square except those on the last rank, and a dropped Pawn is allowed to checkmate.  The same ZRF includes the game Shatranji, invented by myself, which is a hybrid of Shatranj and Shogi. Shatranj is an early Chess variant that is included in the Zillions Fairy Chess ZRF. Shatranji is just like Chessgi except for being based on Shatranj rather than Chess. I invented the game, because a Shogi-like game may work better with weaker pieces, and some of the pieces in Shatranj are weaker than their counterparts in Chess.  The image below is from a Chessgi game I won against Zillions. The ZRF gives you the option of four different piece sets. These include the abstract set pictured with Mortal Chessgi, the magnetic set I included with Magnetic Chess, the motif set pictured with Crazyhouse, and the default Zillions set. Only the abstract set includes specially designed pieces for Shatranji.

All rules of orthodox Chess are kept. Castling is not allowed. The purpose was to design optimal symmetrical setup with maximum of the most popular in the West and in the East Chess Pieces with Pieces density near 50%. To this Game setup extra added very interesting Piece, Chameleon type piece (guest stars), which are invented by Mats Winther. Many Chess parameters in this game are symmetric. For exp., 12 Pawns and 12 Pieces, Setup is central symmetry, Pieces density near 50%, 3x2 simple Pieces (Rook, Bishop, Knight), 3x1 Complex Pieces (Queen, Archbishop, Chancellor), 1x1 Chameleon type Pieces (Chameleon) and 1 King. Pieces set is complete with all combinations of the moves of the light pieces, each Pawn was covered, three consistently located squares has been differently filled. All Pieces have possibility to made first move. Except for a Chameleon type Pieces. A Chameleon is powerful Piece and it is possible to give checkmate to a lonely King. The 10 different Pieces paricipate in this game. This game a little differ from In-Yan Chess.

These three squares constitute the palace, which initially holds the King, the Queen-Guard, and a Knight.","There is no castling for the king is already at a wing (in the palace), and the objective of the game is not just checkmate (which wins as usual), but to invade the palace of the opposing king with your king and capture the scepter. The scepter is located on the 3 squares of the palace, and can only be captured by the opposing king. The scepter must be protected at all cost for losing it forfeits the throne, power - everything!","For full details of the moves please see:  https://www.chess.computerwebservices.net/claustrophobia.php and  https://www.chess.computerwebservices.net/ninjitsu.php for Claustrophobia 2: Ninjutsu","or check the games at chessvariants.org","The rules are as in orthodox chess except as noted below: There is no castling as the king is already in its palace where it is normally safe. In addition to checkmate, a side can also win by capturing the opposing king's scepter. Black's scepter is in the palace on f8,f7,or g7 and white's scepter on f1,f2,or g2. Only the king can capture a scepter, so for example,if the white king marches towards the black king's palace, black can use this opportunity to checkmate, or drive the white king away and march the black king towards the opposing palace. Pawns promote on the last rank to Queen-guard, ninja-guard,flying bomber or knight. The unused squares do not hinder the movement of any pieces. All rules governing draws including stalemate are exactly as in orthodox chess","The Ninja Guard's Moves ------------------------ The Ninja Guard is a color bound piece that can move one or two steps diagonally. It can leap over a diagonally adjacent friendly piece to land exactly 2 squares away (a two-space diagonal leap). It can capture on any square it lands, and additionally it can can capture an enemy piece that is diagonally adjacent by jumping over it. It can capture two pieces (the first immediately adjacent to it, and the next right after) in its path on a diagonal by jumping over the first one and capturing the second piece on the square it lands.","The Ninja Warrior's Moves -------------------------- The Ninja Warrior can move one or two steps orthoganally. It can leap over a friendly piece to land exactly 2 squares away (a two-space orthogonal leap). It can capture on any square it lands, and additionally it can can capture a piece right next to it by jumping over it. It can capture two pieces (the first immediately adjacent to it, and the next right after) in its orthogonal path by jumping over the first one and capturing the second piece on the square it lands.","The Extra-mobile sliding pawn ------------------------------ The pawn moves and captures exactly as in orthodox chess except for the following. Normally, when a pawn faces an opposing pawn or an enemy piece, the pawn is blocked. However, the sliding pawn can, under these circumstances only if it is blocked, slide pass the enemy piece or pawn with the same 1-step diagonal movement that it would make when capturing.","The Queen Guard ---------------- The Queen Guard moves exactly like the King, 1 step orthogonally or diagonally. Ironically, the Queen-Guard despite appearing to be less powerful than the flying bomber, can deliver mate with the help of a king.","The Flying Bomber's Moves -------------------------- The flying bomber's odd combination of long-range and short-range moves makes it a deadly weapon against an unsuspecting opponent.","Standard Move:","The flying bomber eliminates an enemy piece by flying over it, and landing on THE empty square immediately after it on the same orthogonal line. It cannot fly over or capture a second piece or land on any square beyond the first empty square.","The flying bomber can fly along any amount of empty squares (1-9) orthogonally, but not over any friendly pieces. This is identical to the movement of a rook.","For a successful bombing, there must be an empty square immediately after the first enemy piece on the same line.","Special Move: the Helicopter Landing","This is a special maneuver that enables the flying bomber to fly over the adjacent square, (jumping over, if occupied by friendly piece or eliminating if occupied by enemy piece) and land like a helicopter on a square exactly 2 squares away, capturing if possible on this square.

The other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Columbiad. The camelrider moves gives it a good mobility in congested middlegame positions. As it combines mobility with the power of the cannon capture, it is ideal for king-attacks in the middlegame. As it can only capture as a cannon, and not as a knight, this piece is easier to control. The unusual H-shaped board makes it possible to introduce this piece without giving it undue advantage in the opening, thus avoiding monotonous opening strategies. The Columbiad is dangerous in the middlegame, but is perhaps weaker in the endgame, while screens for jumping become fewer.

The players in turn swap, firstly, the king, secondly, the queen. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then has the option to relocate his king. After the kings thus have been swapped the turn goes back to black. The queens can now optionally be relocated. When white has made his queen swap (or dispensed with this possibility) he immediately starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules derive from Fischer Random Chess. White castles in the following way (the Black procedure is equivalent). When castling left (O-O-O) , the king moves to c1 and the rook moves to d1. When castling right (O-O) the king moves to g1 and the rook moves to f1. The following conditions must be true: the king must not move to, from or over an attacked square; the king and rook have never moved; there is no other piece on any square over which the king and rook move. Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","Curtailed castling: as an alternative rule, the king may retain its castling right only if it is placed on any of the four central files. In other words, if the king is positioned on the g or b file, the castling right is forfeited. After all, such a safety move brings certain advantages so it should cost something.

Troyka","created":"2001-03-03","description":["Connected Chess follows the rules of standard chess, with one exception: After each turn all isolated pieces (i.e., pieces not adjacent to any piece of either color) are removed from the board.  In the variant, pieces that are not adjacent to any friendly piece are removed after each turn.  Connected Chess requires careful development of your forces. Pieces typically must work in concert to advance across the board. In the principal game you can move a piece to a space adjacent to an enemy piece, but you should be careful when doing so because the opponent can remove your piece by isolating it. In the variant, you can capture an enemy piece by capturing its only adjacent friend, in which case you get two (or more) captures with a single move. In both the principal game and the variant it is possible to capture up to five enemy pieces in a single move. It is also possible for a piece (not the King) to commit suicide by moving to an isolated space.  Checkmate can be unusual. In the principal game, if the opponent King is adjacent to a friend in an otherwise empty portion of the board, you can checkmate the King by capturing the adjacent piece. In this situation, the King has no available move because reciprocal capture or moving away to an unattacked space would leave the King isolated, which is illegal. This situation is a checkmate, as opposed to a stalemate, so long as the initial capturing piece can capture the King on the next move either by direct capture or by withdrawal to a space beyond the King's reach.  In the illustration below, White has checkmated the Black King. The King is in check because the Rook can capture it through isolation simply by moving away. Black cannot remove the King from check because capturing the Rook would leave the Knight free to isolate the King, and because all other adjacent spaces are attacked.  It is possible for one King to capture the other. A King can move to a space adjacent to the enemy King as long as the enemy King is unable to attack it as a result of the isolation rule. If the moving King is in a position to move away from the enemy King on the next move, and there is no other piece that the enemy King can approach, checkmate will result. If the moving King is not in a position to remove itself from the enemy King, a strange diad may occur: The two Kings must remain adjacent to one another and yet are forbidden from capture by the isolation rule. An example of a game ending in diad can be found in the saved game called \"Diad\" included in the folder.  In the variant, you can checkmate the opponent King by attacking the only piece adjacent to it. If the opponent cannot remove the adjacent piece from attack in a way that keeps it adjacent to the King, or move the King to a space adjacent to\\another friendy piece, the King will be checkmated.

In Crazyhouse, a player gives captured pieces to himself, changing their color, so that they now belong to his side. This makes Crazyhouse a bit less crazy than Bughouse.

Both these titles are offshots of conversion chess. Conversion chess is a type of chess where pieces via capture, and/or position in relation to other pieces, switch sides. The bulk of the game's code, with minor tweaks, comes from W.D Troyka's Benedict Chess. The game has the same variants as found in Benedict chess.   Object:The object of this game is to convert your opponent's king to your color.   Gameplay:Standard chess rules apply, except:  There is no capturing.  At the end of a move, all enemy pieces attacked by the moving piece (under normal chess rules) are flipped to become friendly pieces.  You win by flipping your opponent's King.  In the variant, a promoted piece does not flip opponent pieces on the same turn as the promotion.  Desert Benedict Chess is a wild game of rapidly shifting alliances. Unlike Benedict Chess, however, the line of play tends to be a bit more stable, as it requires pieces to be adjacent to Because there is no capturing, the full complement of 32 pieces remains on the board at all time, and the game is strictly positional.  As with Benedict Chess, flipping the opponent's array pawns is not as advantageous as may first appear. Because they cannot capture, flipped pawns can serve as shields preventing (only for a moment) flipping of the opponent's royal pieces. The end result can be certain bottlenecks on certain parts of the board.   Designer Notes: I had an idea in the back of my head one day to do a hybrid between Chess and Attaxx/Spot (aka, Blobs in Zillions). To do this, I took the basic chess set and had the idea of where moving next to an enemy piece would cause capture. The end result is Desert Benedict which is what I had in mind. It is a game that borrows elements from both. It has the converting of pieces of a player by being next to them from Desert Chess, while not having capture from Benedict. Thus, the game \"Benedict Chess\" got its name. I do want to thank W.D Troyka for letting me use the base code for this variant. Due to this, I was able to get this game done fairly quickly."],"image":"game281_scr_DesertBenedictChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":2}

Historical examples are Sparta, and the Roman Republic during the 'duumvirate'. The game is played on the Gustavian board, invented by King Gustav III of Sweden (cf. Gustav III's Chess).","The enemy Witch has the friendly pieces and pawns under a spell, making them incapable of attacking the enemy Kings. However, the bewitchment does not affect the friendly Witch and Kings. The only way that the spell can be broken is for the friendly Witch to sacrifice herself. Thus, when either of the Witches disappears, the spell is broken for all the pieces on the board. When so happens, the red indicator changes to green. The Witch moves like a Rook and can make one step on the diagonal. The Princess moves like a Bishop and can make one step on the orthogonal. The Kings cannot castle. The Pawn promotes to Queen and other pieces, but not to Witch. The goal is checkmate.","Since Kings are immune against attack from the enemy pieces, except the Witch, they become powerful attacking pieces. It is necessary to take advantage of this opportunity, already early in the game. It creates a very unusual situation on the chess board. However, one must be prepared for the eventuality that the enemy Witch sacrifices herself, in which case the King becomes vulnerable to the enemy pieces. For instance, if a King is placed within the scope of an enemy piece, it allows the enemy Witch to capture a piece. It's not possible to take back, since now the King is in check.

Normal chess rules apply except for the following. Any piece (not pawn) adjacent to the friendly King acquires additional movement powers. Positioned next to the majesty it can move like a Dromedary (Camel), namely leap three squares in a straight line, and one to the side (3+1). So now any piece can go to the kingly stable, mount a Dromedary, and ride away.","The Dromedary, under the name of Camel, is a piece that dates back at least to Tamerlane Chess, allegedly invented by Timur Lenk. The Camel is used in many modern chess variants, but it seldom appears to its advantage since its long leaps makes it somewhat awkward to handle. Another factor is that it is colour-bound and can only reach half of the positions on the board. In this variant the Dromedary capabilities are utilized in a different way. It does not appear as a physical piece. Instead, any piece can, as it were, mount a Dromedary, and make a long leap. Pieces that fulfil the requirements for making a Dromedary leap are referred to as dromedaries, e.g., \"a bishop-dromedary on f1\".","This variant is interesting because there is an inherent conflict between protecting the King, and, on the other hand, to keep the King near the battle situation, while it can increase the strength of the friendly pieces, which can then attack by Dromedary jumps. Probably one should keep the King in the center for a while, and not castle too soon. Already in the middle game, a daring player might advance with the King, in order to provide his army with Dromedary reinforcement.","The endurance and strength of the dromedary (Arabian camel) have made it a valuable beast of burden. The dromedary, generally used as a saddle animal, can cover more than 161 km (100 mi) in a day. It is also an effective battle animal.","There is also a variant where Scorpions take the place of the pawns. The Scorpion has the additional moves of a Knight, but only in two forward directions: east-north-east, and west-north-west. There are no additional capture moves.The Scorpion's value is half the value of a Knight or Bishop, that is, 1.5. This means that a light piece can be exchanged for two Scorpions, a possibility which often occurs. In the endgame it could become very dangerous, and its value often increases.","Dromedary Chess can also be played by email at Chessvariants.org."],"image":"game1252_scr_DromedaryChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":3}

The line pieces (Rook, Ringmaster, Warlord, and Spire) form one such family; the leapers (Knight, Archer, Airman, and Sailor) form another.  When a piece lands on top of another piece in the same family (either friend or foe), it assimilates its powers.  Pieces may not assimilate pieces from a different family.  A Rook-Spire combination is therefore possible, but a Rook-Knight combination is not. A Rook landing on top of a Knight simply captures it as in traditional chess, and removes it from the board.","The leaping pieces may also capture by leaping over an enemy piece.  This converts it to a friendly piece.  A leaper may, in fact, capture two pieces at once: if there are two adjacent enemy pieces, a leaper may jump over the first and land on the second.  The first is converted to a friendly piece; the second is either assimilated (if a fellow-leaper) or removed from the board (if a non-leaper).","Pawns and Guards capture by acting as pincers.

Hence the flanks cannot easily be blocked, something which greatly enhances attacking play.","There are three different variants of dynamic pawns. The pawn is endowed with the extra jump move to an empty square (1) if blocked anywhere on the file (2) if blocked on the 4th rank onwards (3) if blocked on the enemy side. Note that the opponent can prevent this jump move by occupying the square, so it is not always easy to achieve.","In Dynamic Chess (Chess4) black can decide the initial positions of the queens. (If black so chooses, the piece array remains unchanged.) The positions must mirror each other. Dynamic Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the queen and a light piece. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour. Note that black begins by swapping his queen. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is. The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the queens thus have been swapped the turn is still with white.

Instead the Echidna has the power to repulse any piece (friend or foe, including pawns) that is being approached, provided that any intervening squares are empty. The piece is repulsed to the square immediately beyond the next piece, thus causing the startled piece to jump beyond a screen in sheer fright. An enemy piece positioned here would be captured. If there is no screen, or the square behind the screen is occupied by a friendly piece, then no repulsion occurs. In case of an enemy pawn, it cannot be pushed back to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit. The enemy pawn can be pushed to its promotion square, whereby it is promoted to a queen, as only option. A friendly pawn, pushed to the last rank, can promote as usual.

Vacant  Elevator Shafts are denoted by the blue square at their center.","Starting with the White, each player moves either a piece or an Elevator.

Elevators and occupants are moved up or down one level with the yellow dot.   The Pawn(P) may step without capturing either one forward, left or right orthogonal.  \tIt may step two forward orthogonal from its first or second rank, provided that both  \tcells are vacant.  It captures one forward diagonal, and en passant is legal.   \tIt may promote to any previously captured piece on the second-to-last or last rank.   \tChanges levels via Elevator. \t The Flying Rook(R) slides orthogonal.

But when I settled on the name of Eurasian Chess, the idea took on a life of its own. I conceived of the game as a synthesis of some of the main European and Asian forms of Chess, predominantly FIDE Chess and Chinese Chess. But I also based it on Grand Chess, created by Dutch game inventor Christian Freeling, and on the other five main regional variants from Asia, which are Shogi (Japan), Janggi (Korea), Makruk (Thailand), Sittuyin (Burma), and Shatar (Mongolia). Eurasian Chess includes all the pieces from Chess, except that it gives the King some properties of its counterpart in Chinese Chess. It includes the Cannon from Chinese Chess, and it includes the Vao, which Englishman T. R. Dawson created as the diagonal counterpart to the Cannon, which is to the Cannon as the Bishop is to the Rook. Although it contains fewer pieces from Chinese Chess than from Chess, it is still a fair balance between European and Asian variants, given that some of the other main regional variants in Asia are more like European Chess. In fact, of all the pieces in Eurasian Chess, the Queen is the only piece that is common to European variants but not found in any of the main Asian regional variants. Half of the pieces in Eurasian Chess are Chaturanga pieces shared by both FIDE Chess and between three and six of the six main regional variants in Asia. The eight-directional leaping Knight and the divergent Pawn are used in three Asian variants, the eight-directional King in five Asian variants, and the Rook in all six main Asian variants. The additional pieces are the Queen, which comes from Europe; the Cannon, which comes from China; the Bishop, which was created in both Europe and Japan; and the Vao, which is of mixed heritage, because it was created by a European who based it on the Chinese Cannon.  A full description of this game can be found at: http://www.chessvariants.com/large.dir/eurasian.html  The artwork for the game combines characteristics of both European and Chinese sets. The board is checkered like a European board, but by using a floor tile technique, it has tiles intersecting in the middle of each space, so that pieces are also placed on points, as they are in Chinese Chess. The piece set displayed here uses disks for pieces, as is done in China, but uses western images. The western images are colored black and white, as European pieces normally are, but the disks are colored blue and red, which are commonly used for pieces in Chinese Chess. Besides the set shown here, the ZRF uses piece sets I have previously included with Yáng Qí and Chinese Chess.

One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the kings thus have been swapped the turn is still with white. White can now relocate the queen, if he so wishes, and black then mirrors this. Next white starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules are simple and derive from Chess960. King and rook end up on their usual squares. The only difference is that the king can make longer leaps than usual (or shorter, or none at all). All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened.","Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king."],"image":"game1768_scr_FischerPlacementChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":5}

Another way of formulating the rule is that the horses are potentially present on the empty first rank squares. Flexible Chinese Chess is intended as an alternative to standard Chinese Chess, radically increasing the ramification of openings. By waiting a few moves before introducing an external piece, a player can hide his intentions.","Chinese Chess rules","The objective in Chinese Chess is to checkmate the opponent's General. It's also a win to stalemate your opponent so that he can't move - this usually only happens when a player is reduced to a lone king. A player may not force a repetition of moves. The horizontal space across the center of the board is the river separating the territories of the two sides. Elephants are not allowed to cross the river, whereas Soldiers promote once they cross it. The 3x3 box marked with an \"X\" is the General's imperial palace or fortress. Each General and his Mandarins may not leave their fortress. There are seven pieces in Chinese Chess:","Soldier/Pawn (zu/tsut, bing/ping = foot soldier) Soldiers can move forward until they cross the center section of the board (called \"crossing the river\") where they gain the ability to move left and right. The Soldiers are initially positioned on the 4th and 7th rank.","Horse/Knight (ma = horse) Horses move like a Knight in Chess, except that they can't jump over other pieces. They step outward on a row or column, then diagonally outward one step. If something is adjacent to a Horse on a row or column, it can't move in that direction. The Horses are initially positioned on the 2nd and 8th file.","Elephant (xiang/tseung = elephant; xiang/sheung = minister/premier) Elephants move diagonally two steps. However, Elephants cannot jump over other pieces, so an Elephant is blocked in any direction where another piece is diagonally next to it. Elephants are defensive pieces: they must stay on their side of the board and cannot cross the 'river.' The Elephant is similar (but without the ability to leap) to the Alfil in Shatranj, the precursor to the modern Bishop. The Elephants are initially positioned on the 3rd and 7th file.","Chariot/Rook (ju/kui = chariot) Chariots move like the Rook in Western Chess, that is, any number of squares along a row or column. The Chariots are initially positioned in the corners.","Cannon (pao = cannon) Cannons move like Chariots/Rooks, by sliding any number of squares along a row or column, but they can capture an enemy only if there is another piece (of either side) in between. Thus to capture they leap over the intervening piece and land on the enemy piece, like a cannonball. One account of Xiangqi dates the introduction of the cannon at 839 A.D. The Cannons are initially positioned on the 3rd and 8th rank.","Mandarin (shi/see = counsellor) The Mandarin must stay confined to the fortress, and can only move a single step along the diagonal lines shown. This gives it only 5 possible positions. This piece is often translated into other names such as Assistant, Guard, Counsellor, and Officer. The Mandarins are placed beside the General.","General/King (jiang/cheung = general, shuai/sui = general) The General is confined to the fortress and can only move a step at a time horizontally or vertically. It also has the special power to threaten an enemy General across the board along an open column. For this reason, it is not permitted to make a move that leaves the two Generals facing each other with nothing in between. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's General. The General is positioned in the middle."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":2}

The game is similar to regular chess in that you win by checkmating your opponent.  The twist Forwards Chess adds to regular chess is that pieces do not move to the side or backwards. The variants, and Dipole Chess are by Richard Hutnik.","RULES The object of the game is to either capture (or checkmate, depending on variant) your opponent's king, or stalemate your opponent (they are unable to make a legal move).  Please check different variants in the ZRF file for game specific rules.","Latest version of the rules to Forwards Chess can be found here:","www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSforwardschess","Latest version of the rules to Dipole Chess can be found here:","http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSdipolechess","NOTES Also included in this ZRF is Dipole Chess by Richard Hutnik.  Dipole Chess is inspired by Forwards Chess, but also borrows from the ability to capture backwards, as in the Mark Steere game Dipole.  This connection was made, because both Dipole and Forwards Chess are tempo games, where you try to outlast your opponent.  Because of the nature of these games pawn promotion and rooks are devalued greatly."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":12}

The positions must mirror each other. Future Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the king + queen and another piece. The king may not swap with any of the rooks. The queen can be swapped with one of the rooks provided that the king remains between the rooks (this is a requirement of Chess960).","Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the kings thus have been swapped the turn is still with white. White can now relocate the queen, if he so wishes, and black then mirrors this. Next white starts the game by making the first move. Diagrams of the 25 possible setups can be viewed here.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. Castling rules derive from Chess960 but have been extended. King and rook end up on their usual squares, but the king also has the option to jump one square farther toward the corner (so that it ends up on the b- or h-file). All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened.","Note! If the King starts the game on a castling destination square (b, c, g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook.","The curious but useful board was invented by king Gustav III of Sweden (see Gustav III's Chess). The extra corner squares (citadels) are also known from medieval big board variants, such as Citadel Chess (14th century?). The board sizes were either 10x10 or 12x12 and had four extra protruding squares that served as sanctuaries for the king. (cf. Pritchard: The Classified Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, p.244). The extended castling rule makes play on the wings easier to achieve.

They are basicly 8x8 fields with the outer cells and the second corner cells cut off.  Or a 6x6 field with its corner cells removed.","Each field will be considered connected to the others in a circular manner, meaning that the first is below the second which is below the third which in turn is below the first.  The c2 cell of one field is orthogonal to the c2 cell of the other two.  This makes the b2, c1, c3 and d2 cells of the other fields diagonal to that same c2 cell.  And b1, b3, d1 and d3 of the other fields are triagonal to that c2 cell.","THE PIECES","DUNGEON MASTER leaps to any vacant cell on any field, leaving a Hole behind which no piece may land on.  Does not capture any piece, can only be captured by Grue.  A player may also rotate the level that this piece occupies 1/4 of a turn as a move if the opposing DM is not present on that level.  Represented by an `X`.","GRUE moves orthogonally, may leap over any number of occupied cells or Holes, excluding those which are occupied by Fire of either player.  Must end its move on the first vacant cell.  Can capture Water or Dungeon Master.  If there is a vacant cell directly between it and another Grue, regardless of owner, a new Grue may be spawned as a move.  If the Grue performs a capture, it may make another move including spawning another Grue.  Represented by a question mark because none who have seen a Grue have survived, and those who perished by a Grue rarely actually saw it coming.","WATER spawns more Water in any one adjacent diagonal cell.  Can only capture Fire.  Represented by three wavy lines.","FIRE spawns more Fire in any one adjacent triagonal cell.  Can only capture Grue. Represented by an open triagonal.","Grue, Fire and Water will move to and from each field according to their particular move restriction.  Note that Fire is only able to move by changing fields.  Spawning moves are accomplished by simply tounching the piece to spawn and releasing it.","The Dungeon Master is an amalgamation of two pieces within the game of Survivor located in RTZ.  The pieces of Grue, Fire and Water were based upon elements within a form of Rock-Paper-Scissors located in ZGI.","THE SETUP","Each field is initially occupied by one type of piece of each player, either Grue, Fire or Water.  The players choose which field will hold these pieces in turns.  Four of the same will be placed in the first rank of four cells on any one side of a field, with the other player placing on the four far cells directly across.","It is not necessary that each player place the same piece as the opponent on the same field.  Nor is it necessary to place pieces on the same side of the field on each level.","Then each player will place their Dungeon Master in turn on any vacant cell of any field.  And the game commences.","Just touch the cell where you want your Dungeon Master to move, and like magic, it will move there.  To rotate a field, simply touch the desired directional arrow below it.  Be sure that SMART MOVES is activated in OPTIONS located in the VIEW section.","The game is won by either capturing the opposing Dungeon Master, stalemating the opponent, or capturing all opposing Fire, Grue and Water."],"image":"game1085_scr_GUE3DChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[32,12,27],"variations":0}

Game goals"," - to capture both of the enemy Galas (kings). Alternatively, it's sufficient to capture one of the Galas (preferable)."," - to move both Galas to the four central squares.","(there is also a variant where lone Gala loses) Certain wins are regarded as finer:"," - Great victory: a player has placed both Galas in the centre."," - Minor victory: a player has placed one of his Galas in the centre and eliminated both","enemy Galas.","Draw occurs when both players have one Gala in the \"holy centre\", and there are no more Galas on the board. The pieces Pieces capture by entering a square which is occupied by an enemy","piece. For the Kampas and the Horsas there are some restrictions in capturing while crossing a","mound line (see below). Pieces may not cross two mound lines in one move. The centre, consisting of four squares, is an","\"holy site\", and only the Galas and the Kampas are able to enter there. The Kampas can only enter if the centre is already occupied by a Gala, or by an enemy Kampa. Kampa ('warrior') initially moves one step diagonally towards the centre. After being promoted the Kampa can move and capture one step in all directions. But the Kampa is not allowed to enter the inner part of the friendly castles, because this area is reserved for the higher classes. Two variants of Gala have been implemented. They differ only in Kampa promotion: (1) promotion occurs after the first move (2) promotion occurs after passing the line to the cross (second game variant: \"weak Kampas\"). In variant (1), should the Kampa return to any of the initial squares of the friendly Kampas, its movement capability is again restricted to the initial movement.  In variant (2), should it return to any of the friendly castles its movement capability is again restricted to the initial movement  (excepting the square diagonally adjacent to the centre). When passing the line, inwards or outwards, the Kampa cannot capture.  Korna ('berserk warrior')  moves orthogonally outside the cross. Moves diagonally inside. Can make an additional move after crossing the line. If the Korna crosses the line with the first square he moves, he can move, in addition, any number of free squares diagonally. Otherwise, when crossing the line, his additional move is only one square diagonally. If you don't want to make the additional move, you must press the pass button. If capture occurs when crossing the line, there is no additional move.","Horsa ('horseman', or 'mounted warrior') moves diagonally outside the cross. Moves orthogonally inside. Can make an additional move after crossing the line. If the Horsa crosses the line with the first square he moves, he may move, in addition, any number of free squares orthogonally. Otherwise, when crossing the line, his optional additional move is only one square orthogonally. If capture occurs when crossing the line, there is no additional move. Note! In its first move the Horsa can only move one step.","Note: when crossing the line inwards, the Horsa is not allowed to capture an adjacent piece to the sides (i.e. any piece which is positioned alongside the line which is passed over). The Horsa (the mounted lancer), when jumping over the mound, needs space to be able to turn his horse, catch up speed, and continue the attack. There is an additional variant (\"strong Horsas\"), where the Horsa is still allowed to capture a piece to the side if it's aligned with the movement direction. In both cases the Horsa can capture an adjacent piece which is orthogonally \"forward\".","Gala ('king') can move a single step in any direction. The Gala loses the ability to capture when positioned inside the centre. (There is also a variant, \"weak Galas\", where the Gala is not allowed to capture when entering the centre.) From inside the centre, it can move directly to any empty square, other than the initial positions of the pieces."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[32,12],"variations":15}

Instead the Gastrophete, when it moves, has the power to sling a piece located immediately behind itself to a forward square in the alignment direction. The slung piece, which can be of any colour, is the adjacent piece in the opposite direction of the move. This piece is hurled to the square immediately forward of the square on which the Gastrophete stops. Any enemy piece positioned here is captured. Thus the Gastrophete can be used for transporting friendly pieces, attacking enemy pieces, or removing enemy pieces from good positions. In opening and middlegame the Gastrophete introduces new tactical themes. If it remains on the first rank it can transport the rooks and the king very effectively along the first rank. In the endgame it can transport friendly pawns and the friendly king over the board. It can open files for the rooks, by removing a friendly pawn sideways. Enemy pieces can be kidnapped and subsequently attacked. Pawns can be catapulted to their promotion square, when they are promoted to queen as only alternative. Pawns cannot be catapulted to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit. Kings and rooks retain their castle rights if catapulted away and back, while they haven't moved by their own accord. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Gastrophete. The Gastrophete's value is the same as a bishop (preliminary estimate). The movement of the Gastrophete makes an authentic impression, and is close to how Gastrophetes were used in reality.

Pieces move as in orthodox chess. The pawns also move as in orthodox chess, but have no initial double move. As the pawns are all located on the third rank, they can reach the fourth rank immediately anyway. Castling doesn't exist. In the first phase the players take turns to drop pieces on the board (two moves per turn), either behind the pawn chain, or on a friendly pawn. In the latter case the removed friendly pawn must immediately be relocated to another empty position, that is, somewhere on the second rank. The rooks must only be dropped on the first rank. The two bishops must be dropped on different colours. After all the pieces have been dropped the play begins.","Geminus Chess is a double-move variant. The double-move, after the dropping phase, is constituted by a pawn move followed by a piece move, which is mandatory. There exist two variants of Geminus Chess. In one variant pawn moves are compelled, until there exist no more pawn moves, when the pieces can continue moving without being preceded by a pawn move. Should a pawn become free to move again, it is compelled to move. In the other variant the player may abstain from the pawn move, and instead move a piece, but then he has lost his double-move.","Note that a player, when the king is threatened, can make a pawn move before taking measures to protect the king. He can also make a pawn move that discloses his king to an enemy piece, but he is well adviced to protect his king in the subsequent move. This implementation only allows promotion to queen.","Geminus Chess is a combination of Swedish Chess and Twinmove Chess. In Geminus Chess the 'en passant' capture, the pawn's double step, and castling, are all redundant.

It captures on the second leg only. The Gladiatrix can also move by colliding against the margin, whereby only one movement direction is available after collision. Without screens to collide against the Gladiatrix cannot move. The Gladiatrix's value is 6, which corresponds to rook + pawn (preliminary estimate). Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Gladiatrix. The Gladiatrix is the most powerful of the bifurcation pieces. It is, arguably, the most agile among all the known pieces. It has the capacity of zigzaging between the pieces and find its way in quite congested situations. As it moves by coordinating with other pieces, the Gladiatrix is a highly cooperative piece. The structure on the board decides its possibilities. Although screens for colliding become fewer, the Gladiatrix does not loose power in the endgame. But, unlike the rook, the Gladiatrix cannot, together with the king, give mate to the enemy king. The unusual H-board makes it possible to introduce the Gladiatrix while allowing it a proper amount of movement freedom in the opening. Note that, on the knight-files, the Gladiatrix can also collide orthogonally with the margin and continue to the extra corner square.","Gladiatrix Chess can also be played with Kwaggas instead of knights. The Kwagga moves like an extended knight, three squares orthogonally plus one step to the side. It can multiply this jump in the same direction. This means that the Kwagga moves like a Camelrider.

Updated May 10, 2003: several mods by L. Lynn Smith. Rabbit Elimination and Immobilization wins added by Tim O'Lena, June 2020. Translated into the Hexagonal Domain June 2020 by Tim O'Lena.","See the 'Learn to Play' section on www.arimaa.com for an animated tutorial.","Objective There are three ways to win a game of Arimaa. The first player to get just one Rabbit across the board to a goal cell wins. On this Hexagonal board, Gold's goals are the 11 hexes spanning a6-f11-k6; Silver's goals span a1-f1-k1. Another way to win is to eliminate all of the opponent's Rabbits. In standard Arimaa, you win if you capture the opponent's last Rabbit, even if you sacrifice your own last Rabbit to do so. The third way to win is by immobilizing your opponent. Stalemate is a LOSS for the immobilized side.","Setup The game has no fixed starting position for the pieces.  The game starts","with an empty board.  First Gold sets down all Gold pieces, in any order, based on the diamond configuration of the McCooey Hexagonal Chess set-up (White side).  Silver then sets up all the Silver pieces,  based on the diamond configuration of the McCooey Hexagonal Chess set-up (Black side). Once the peices have been set down the players take turns moving the pieces with Gold going first. Each player has 7 Rabbits, 3 Cats, 2 Dogs, 2 Horses, 1 Camel and 1 Elephant. It is common to guard the traps with Cats in standard Arimaa. Since each side has three traps in Hexagonal Arimaa, it may be convenient to have three cats to match.","Steps In each turn the players can take up to 4 steps. All pieces move the same way, which","is laterally (i.e. left, right, forward and back). Except that Rabbits cannot move","backwards.  Moving a piece from its current square to an adjacent square counts","as one step.  The 4 steps can be distributed across multiple pieces.  Thus a player","can move one piece 4 steps, four pieces 1 step each,one piece 3 steps and another","piece 1 step,  etc. The same piece may take steps in different directions. A player must change the configuration of the board on every turn - it is illegal to cancel your own moves out, resulting in no change to the position. The position must be different at the end of a players turn. You may pass up to three of your four moves if you like.","Pushing and Pulling A piece can push opponents weaker pieces to any laterally adjacent square and","move into its place. This is called 'pushing' and uses up 2 steps; one for","pushing the opponents piece and one for moving into its square. Pushing must","be completed within a players turn and cannot be distributed across turns.  The Elephant is the strongest and can push any other piece except another Elephant. The Elephant is followed in strength by the Camel, then the Horse, Dog, Cat and","finally the Rabbit which is the weakest and cannot push any other piece.  Pieces","of equal strength cannot push each other. A piece can also pull opponents adjacent weaker pieces","into the square that it moved from.  This is called 'pulling' and uses up","2 steps; one for moving the piece and one for pulling the opponents piece. A piece cannot simultaneously push and pull. You may push or pull only one opposing piece at a time. But it is possible and legal to push and/or pull twice in the same turn, using the four available steps.","Example: Gold's Elephant on b1 moves to c1, pulling a Silver cat from a1 to b1. That uses two steps. In the next two steps, Gold moves the Elephant from c1 to c2, pushing a Rabbit from c2 to c3. In this example, Gold could also have chosen to pull the Cat twice, with the Cat ending on c1.","Freezing A piece that is alone and adjacent to an opponents stronger piece is","considered 'frozen' and cannot move. A piece is considered to be alone if","there are no friendly pieces laterally adjacent to it. The lonely weaker piece","can be 'unfrozen' by moving any other friendly piece next to it. When no longer","alone the weaker piece is unfrozen and can immediately begin to move within","the same turn.","Traps The positions at c3, c6, f3, f9, i3 and i6 are called 'traps'. Any piece that is standing","on a trap is immediately removed from the board if there are no friendly pieces","adjacent to it. A piece may safely stand on or pass through a trap as long as there is","a friendly piece adjacent to it. If the friendly piece moves away then the lonely","piece on the trap is immediately removed from the board.","Notes about the Zillions implementation * To pass the move, click on the 'change turns' button. * Use the 'Variety' slider under Play \u003e Computer Opponent to get Zillions of Games to create varied starting set-ups."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

All rules are adapted to the new board shape as closely as possible. The major change from a square-shaped to a hex-shaped board involves the  number of squares which are considered adjacent to another square. On the  normal chess board, a square usually has 8 neighbours. On the hex-board,  a square (or better, a hex) has 12 neigbours: There are now 6 'orthogonal'  and 6 'diagonal' directions, as opposed to 4 each. Consequently, 3 different colours are used to make orientation easier, so  when moving in an 'orthogonal' direction, the hex colour changes with every  step. When moving 'diagonally', it stays the same. A side effect of this point  of view is that 'diagonally' moving pieces appear to 'jump' hexes, which is  not really true: The Knight remains the only jumping piece.","This hex-transition by Dave McCooey is one of the more logical ones. Most  chess rules remained, and everything works as one would expect it. The rule changes in detail: 1. There is no castling. 2. The centre Pawn may not double-step. (The second change was made in order to disallow White to seize the centre  with her first move.)","Due to the increased mobility of pieces, the material that can force checkmate  in the endgame has also changed. Among other observations, Mr McCooey found out  that two Knights can now force checkmate against the lone King.

The pieces move as in orthodox chess, with the exception of the additional piece, the Bodyguard (also called 'Senior Adviser' or 'Warrior'). It slides one or two steps in any direction. The Bodyguard has about the same value as a rook + two pawns (my estimate). A Bodyguard cannot checkmate (or capture) the enemy king. The Bodyguard can stymie the movement of enemy pieces, except the horse. This implies that an enemy piece can only move one square at at time so long its movement occurs on the squares immediately surrounding the Bodyguard. The horse, being so important in Mongolian life, is not affected by the stymieing powers of the Bodyguard. The pawns move as in orthodox chess, inclusive of the initial double-step and 'en passant'. The pawn can also make an initial triplicate step, which means that 'en passant' can also be performed when the enemy pawn stops on the rank behind the friendly pawn. Pawns promote only to queen. Castling does not exist. The positions of white king and queen are interchanged (compared with standard chess). In Hiashatar, the restrictions for checkmating, which are characteristic of Shatar (8x8 Mongol Chess), are absent.","Thanks to its stymieing capability the Bodyguard is immune against long-range attacks from enemy queen, rook, and bishop. This also means that these pieces cannot easily guard friendly pieces being threatened by an enemy Bodyguard. This makes the Bodyguard a very useful attacking piece in the middlegame. If the Bodyguard is placed centrally during the middlegame, it effectively stymies the long-range enemy pieces. The horse, however, remains a serious threat to the Bodyguard. The Bodyguard's inability to threaten the enemy king is a serious deficit. There is no castling in Hiashatar, and removing the king from its exposed position in the centre is not always necessary, thanks to the effective protective capability of the Bodyguard. In an additional variant the Bodyguard stymies also friendly pieces, and can capture only the nearest square. This is possibly an authentic historical variant.","The word 'Hiashatar' means 'Bodyguard Chess' (Shatranj). This game is still played in Mongolia, although Fide-chess is taking over more and more. Hiashatar is said to have appeared 500 years ago.","References","http://www.geocities.com/kisslook/eng/mongeng.html  http://history.chess.free.fr/hiashatar.htm"],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,34],"variations":2}

Each player begins with one Queen, two Highborns, two Drones, two Nurses, five Workers and three Soldiers.","Each cell occupied by a Worker denotes the potential of the Hive. Each Worker can support five units. During any turn, multiply the number of friendly Worker-occupied cells by five. This represents the number of the Hive. If the value of the pieces on the field is equal to or greater than this number, the player is unable to exercise the production phase of their turn.","Each turn players are allowed to introduce one new piece for each of their Nurses. Only Workers, Soldiers, Nurses and Drones are allowed to be introduced. Soldiers to any vacant cell adjacent any friendly piece. Workers, Drones and Nurses to vacant cells adjacent a friendly Nurse. There must be the necessary Workers and Nurse on the field to support them before the production phase. Only two Drones, two Nurses and eight Workers are allowed on the field. The number of Soldiers is only limited by the number of Workers and available cells on the field.","Workers, Soldiers, Nurses and Drones are equal to one unit each. Highborns are three units. Queens are six units.","Movement of Pieces:","The Queen[Q] may swap poisition with any friendly Highborn. This is its only form of movement. The Queen does not attack. Each player must have a Queen on the field at the end of their movement phase.","The Highborn[H] slides through vacant cells and can take any enemy-occupied cell on its last cell. A Highborn may be promoted to a Queen if its Queen has been captured and there is at least one Drone on the field. There must be the necessary friendly Workers on the field to support this promotion.","The Soldier[S] steps to enemy-occupied cell, or leaps orthogonal over friendly pieces to enemy-occupied cell.","Worker[W] steps to vacant cell.","Drone[D] leaps to any vacant cell.","Nurse[N] may swap position with any friendly piece except Highborn and Queen.","Player's turn:","1) Movement - mandatory The player moves one piece, or promotes a Highborn.

Each player has a single piece called the Monarch that can move to any square on the board that can be reached by a combination of orthogonal moves.  The move must end by pushing or pulling a Soldier in a straight line any number of vacant spaces.  Soldiers are neutral pieces that cannot move on their own.  Win by capturing the opposing Monarch or crushing it so that it cannot move.","The Monarchs are separated by a wall of Soldiers called the Front.  Behind the Front, the area through which the Monarch can move is called its Dominion.  The effect of the Monarch's motion is to push and pull the Front so that it forms an ever changing line separating the players.  Basic strategy consists of forcing the enemy Monarch to breach the Front so that it can be captured on the next turn, or collapsing the Front around the Monarch until it is crushed.","Hobbes is named after Thomas Hobbes, a 17th-century British philosopher who argued that power naturally gravitates to a single absolute Monarch.  The game was invented in 1998 and inspired by Robert Kraus' Neutron.","Hobbes comes with 2-player and 4-player variants played on 5x5, 7x7, and 9x9 boards.  In the 4-player variants the game continues until a single Monarch remains.  Smart Moves must be selected in order to play the 4-player variants. You can design your own variants by right-clicking to place the pieces.","A Monarch move is normally accomplished by first moving the Monarch to a square adjacent to a Soldier, then pushing or pulling the Soldier.  If the Soldier is on the same rank or file as the Monarch, a push may be accomplished in one step.  If a move could be either a maneuver (push or pull) or a Dominion move to be followed by a maneuver, Zillions will offer you a selection box.","Hobbes was conceived as a 5x5 game and is most entertaining at that size.  The 5x5 version can almost certainly be solved and I would welcome any formal proof.  I have worked out an informal solution using Zillions that gives the first player a win in 19 moves.  The first player can be handicapped by prohibiting a forward opening move.","Please send any comments or bug reports to dtroyka@justice.com."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[32,12,14],"variations":3}

The game has a simple set-up.  All pieces move and capture the same.  There are  only two types of pieces:  1 King and the rest are Soldiers.

The line of 5 must include the King anywhere within the line.; or  Reduce your opponent to less then 5 pieces.   All pieces slide like rooks in Chess, i.e. any number of empty spaces up, down,  left, or right.  A piece can also make a single jump over another piece of either  color that is adjacent to it horizontally or vertically.  The jumping piece lands on the other side.  This is not a capture.  The only capturing is achieved by  sandwiching your opponent's pieces between yours along a row or column.   This is similar to Reversi, except that the pieces are removed from the board  instead of flipped.

It can capture by replacement only on the square it lands. The Warmachine Alfil can move one or leap two steps orthogonally or leap 2 squares diagonally. It is the exact inverse of the Battle Templar. It can capture by replacement only on the square it lands.  The Ferz-Knight - moves like a knight or makes one step diagonally.

The piece can only be moved on the next turn.","Transforming into another piece also takes a turn.","The mutating serpent must be dropped as one of its mutating forms, and it can mutate only after making at least one move during its current mutation. Thus, if dropped as a raptor it can only be transformed into a Flying Bomber any turn after making a move as a Raptor.","The serpent mutations: (see piece help for more detailed info)","Flying Bomber moves like a rook and captures by flying over enemy. It also makes a special capture by replacement 2 squares away. It can also jump over an adjacent friendly piece.  The raptor is the diagonal version of the Flying Bomber.   The Cannon is the same piece as in Chinese chess.  The Vao is the diagonal equivalent of cannon.  The Stealth Gryphon slides to squares along an unobstructed path of one diagonal square followed by two or more orthogonal squares outwards.  The Stealth Anti-Gryphon - Slides along unobstructed path of one orthogonal square followed by two or more diagonal outwards.  The Ferz Sorcerer jumps an extended leap like a zebra or steps one diagonally. The Wazir Conjurer jumps an extended leap like a camel or steps one orthogonally.","The Ninja Pawns:","This special pawn can move/capture like a regular pawn as well as move 1 space sideways. When in enemy territory it can also capture 1 space sideways.

The rook always ends up next to the king on the other side as in standard chess. The same rules: cannot castle out of check, king cannot pass over squares attacked by enemy etc apply.  The choice of castling depends on whether it is more desirable to immediately  have the rook in the center file or the king tucked away at the wing.","Note: When carrying out 1 step castling, Zillions pops up a box asking to choose a move.  The second move indicating kings move AND the rook to move to king square is the castling move.","The standard pawn move is modified slightly - it can now move 1,2, or 3 squares initially. It can also move two spaces forward if it moved only 1 space or captured from original position.","En-passant is modified to accommodate this. A pawn that attempts to bypass an enemy pawn by making a double or triple move is captured En-passant.","This En-passant only applied to standard pawns.

You play as Red against Blue.Every board position is treated as an 'island' which may or may not have bridges (connections) to the eight adjacent board positions. The connections are shown as short lines between the positions. The connections are NOT painted on the board, but are pieces that can be set or deleted.In the default variant the connections on the main diagonals are missing. The other variants have other connections missing.There is also a variant (the last one) where you can design your own Island Chess board (Hit DELETE key + Mouse to erase connections, use right mousekey to change any connections).  The chess pieces can only move along directions that have the associated connections intact. This is obvious for most chess pieces. The Knight's move is considered consisting of one orthogonal and one diagonal move.  Apart from this, the standard chess rules apply.  Variant 2: The central diagonal connections are missing.Variant 3: The connections between the four central squares are missing.Variant 4: Top and lower half of board are only connected via the 4 central files.Variant 5: All connections are given (standard chess board); create your own setup.

The board is 21 squares long, and the aim is to checkmate the enemy King. Captured pieces become the property of the captor and can be dropped back into play as in standard Shogi. Ito Shogi uses the promotion rules of Micro-Shogi: pieces are flipped back and forth between their promoted value and their original value each time they make a capture.   With no room to move sideways and with the threat of enemy pieces being dropped into play, tight tactics are important in this game. Seizing the initiative is often more important than material gain in order to win. It is all too easy to find yourself trapped in a zugzwang position, from which your only available move will lead to defeat.   The pieces are adapted from familiar Shogi variants: - from Modern Shogi: the King, the Bishop, the Lance, the Knight, the Silver General and the Pawn; - from Chu Shogi: the Phoenix and the Go-Between; - from Dai Shogi: the Iron General; - from DaiDai Shogi: the Howling Dog; - from Tai Shogi: the Ramshead Soldier; - from Wa Shogi: the Heavenly Horse; - from Tori Shogi: the Goose; - from Cannon Shogi (used with permission): the Silver Cannon and the Gold Cannon.   This game includes both a Kanji piece set and a Western piece set; the western piece-set illustrates the movement capabilities of the pieces they represent.

The original Zillions version simply had different set-ups as  variants.  In this version, players drop their Horse and Elephant pieces in the  formation of their choosing prior to play.  I have tried to make this easier for  players by having Zillions automatically dropping Elephants besides their  Horses, so that you only have to drop two pieces (Horses) instead of four (both  horses and both Elephants).","This version of Janggi includes a script for running one of four different  Janggi scripts, namely:  Small board and pieces , in color   Large board and pieces   Black \u0026 White  Set, intended mostly copying games from Korean books,        should you have any.  To this end, there are 3 boards showing rank and        file labes.  One shows an Algebraic grid, one shows digits and [Chinese]        numerals often found in Korean Janggi books and the last is an all-digit        grid system, as used by the Korean Janggi Association.   Bakbo (mating problem) editor, to create and view your own mating        problems, or games you played and wanted to record a satisfying position,        but did not record the moves prior to this point.   Janggi pieces are octagons, unlike the circular Chinese Chess pieces.  There are  also 3 sizes of pieces, related to their value:  Generals are largest, Rooks,  Cannons, Horses and Elephants are mid-sized and Soldiers (pawns) and Ministers  are the smallest.  The grid of Janggi boards, unlike Chinese Chess boards, are  not formed with sqares, but oblong boxes wider than they are tall.","This version includes the \"Bigjang\" rule of Janggi.  It is similar to the \"No  Bare Kings\" rule of Chinese chess, except that if both players' generals face  each other across the board without intervening pieces, it is a forced draw and  not a win or loss.  Also included are [semi-official] handicap games, as  variants.","One further change in this version is that the Red Player (Han) sets up first  and moves second.  This gives slightly more advantage to the Blue Player (Cho).   This is something I had overlooked in my previous Janggi ZRF modules.","I have included numerous example games (ZSG files) for this script.  There are  several readme files for a full explanation of these game files.

Mr. Kim can be  reached at janggidosa@yahoo.co.kr  if you wish to contact him about Janggi Dosa  and perhaps try to encourage him to create an English version of this fine  program, which he has not done to date due to a lack of interest of this fine  program outside of Korea (to date).","For more information on Janggi, please visit: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Janggi (or send a subscription request to  Janggi-subscribe@yahoogroups.com)"],"image":"game153_scr_Janggi.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,23],"variations":8}

The object                 of the game is either to capture the enemy Princess or the Chieftain                 with any piece. Pieces in Jetan move in combinations of directions,                 which means they are free to change their direction during their                 move so long they do not cross the same square twice in a single                 move. Pieces may only capture on their final square.              The                 rules of Jetan were described in the science fiction novel \"The                 Chessmen of Mars\", Vol 5 of the \"Martian Tales\",                 by Edgar Rice Burroughs in 1922. So many wrong rules are given in                 sources, one may wonder: BUT, WHO REALLY READ THAT BOOK? At the                 last page of the book, Burroughs made a summary of the rules. Gollon                 took these rules for his own book (\"Chess Variations Ancient,                 Regional and Modern\") but could have made a few mistakes. One                 was corrupting some piece names. Another was probably a wrong assumption                 on the Thoat move (see variants). Further descriptions, Pritchard                 for example, followed Gollon. The first description given in the                 Chess Variant Pages from Hans Bodlaender on Internet, contained                 many other discrepancies from this genuine rules (Padwar moving                 orthogonally and more).               Here,                 the corrected actual rules are proposed here (well, except the draw-condition).                 Also, the name of the pieces have been restored to the ones given                 by Burroughs: Panthan, not Panthon or Panton; Flier, not Odwar which                 is another piece,..."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":5}

The pieces are initially     forbidden from retreating, forcing the game into an advancing attack.  Upon reaching the far end of the     board, pieces promote with the increased power of being able to move both backwards and forwards.  Captures are      compulsory, enabling players to lay traps for each other by forcing an unfavorable exchange for a favorable one      or a better position.  This game is an attempt to blend these elements in with Chess.                 Of all the family of Chess games,     Shogi is the one that most easily lends itself to this kind of play.  It already has a number of pieces with a forward     orientation and the majority of pieces promote in some way.  Additionally, the compulsory capture rule, where a      piece is sacrificed in order to achieve a strategic advantage, can be seen as an inversion of Shogi's 'in hand' rule,     where a strategic advantage is achieved by obtaining enemy pieces. Not to mention the ancient Japanese code of     Bushido, where it was considered a disgrace to refuse a fight and the greatest honor was to die in the service of one's     lord.                 Ravens, Priests, and Squires are apprentice Chess pieces that move like Rooks, Bishops and Knights respectively,     except they are forbidden from any backwards movement. When they cross the far promotion line they promote and gain their     full abilities to move backwards and forwards.                 Pawns move one space forward and capture diagonally forwards, as in      Western Chess.  When they cross the promotion line, they promote to Gold Generals.

The pieces have similar names, but their moves differ somewhat from Chinese Chess. The goal is to checkmate the opponent's General. The river is unimportant to the rules, and there is no promotion. Soldiers, Chariots, and Cannons can move along diagonals when in either side's fortress. Players are allowed to interchange a Horse and Elephant if they want before the game commences. It's allowable to pass a move anytime, so stalemate does not exist. To pass a move: lift and drop the General. Korean Chess takes longer to play than Chinese Chess, often 100 moves before a conclusion is reached. On the other hand, it is relatively fast paced.","Korean Chess evolved either from Xiangqi or from a common ancestor. There has not been much written about Korean Chess. The first Korean Chess association was formed in Korea in 1956.

I loved Infinite Chess, but thought there was room for improvement in the placing and movement capability of the Pawns.  Because the Infinite Chess game is proprietary, I realized that I would have to change more than just the pawns in order to make what I could present as a game of my own.  Besides the Pawn modifications, I have customized the promotion rules and checkmate rules, added several new pieces, and renumbered the board in a way that is (to me) more user-friendly.","The standard chess pieces are used (1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 8 Pawns), as well as four \"fairy\" pieces : 1 Empress (a Rook-Knight combination), 1 Princess (a Rook-Bishop combination), 1 Crusader (a King-Knight combination), and 1 Crown Prince (moves like a King, but is not royal).  There is also the Steward, which exists only as a promotion piece : on entering the \"enemy zone,\" a Pawn becomes a Steward, which moves passively in any orthogonal direction, and captures in any diagonal direction.","White Pawns move in a Southwest-Northeast or a Northwest-Southeast direction (the latter are shown upside down, for clarity).  Black Pawns similarly move in a Southeast-Northwest or a Northeast-Southwest direction (again, the latter are shown upside down).","The game is won by checkmating or stalemating the opponent.  The King is immobilized when attacked, meaning that a check must be relieved in some other way - either by blocking the line of attack or by capturing the attacker.  I settled on this rule after playtesting with zillions revealed that it is often impossible to force checkmate on a virtually seamless board like this one.

Parton's Alice Chess (where pieces change board each time they move), with the array from George Deckle Sr.'s Lilliputian Chess. It is played on a stack of two 6x7 boards.  A piece always ends up on a square of the same color on which it started. When it makes a move -- either capturing or non-capturing -- to a square of the other color, after the move completes, the piece `falls` through to the other board, where the checking is reversed, thus keeping on the same color. If the square on the other board is occupied, then the move is not allowed.  The King may not move into an attacked square, then fall out of it. However, check may be blocked by a piece falling through.  Pawns promote at the back row of either board.

What if in a Chess game all pieces except the King would move and capture in different ways? The three basic pieces, Rook, Bishop and Knight, give rise to six combinations. These consist of a top-piece called the hunter which constitutes the way the piece captures and a bottom-piece called the carrier, which constitutes the way the piece moves. Of course only hunters can give check, therefore a piece is called after its hunter. Also there are piece drops to avoid a drawish system; capture those enemy pieces and have them work for you!","As an afterthought came the concept of Dragonfly, which may be considered as 'normal Loonybird'.","The differences with orthodox Chess:","The nature of the pieces has been explained, but for the option to re-enter them. If a piece is captured, it becomes the captor's property and he may drop it, at the cost of a turn, on any empty square. Until dropped, the captured piece stays put beside the captor's side of the board. As in all systems that feature the re-entering of pieces, this is called a 'piece in hand'.","Pawns are the same as in orthodox Chess, but are not allowed the initial double step. They promote on moving to the far side to a piece the opponent has in hand. Pawns, if captured, are out of the game.","The King is the same as in orthodox Chess.

Leigh","created":"2018-12-29","description":["HISTORY: Let me tell you about Martian Cake: Through his telescope, a Martian sees an Earthman approaching in a rocket, and wants to make him feel at home. So he bakes a cake. Unfortunately, all he knows about cake is what he's seen through his telescope, so he substitutes local ingredients. It looks beautiful, but the Earthman is immediately poisoned upon eating it.","That's the design conceit of this game. What might Chess look like if it were \"re-created\" by someone who's had glance at the game, but never learned the rules and doesn't even quite remember what the pieces look like, or even what size the board is? He knows that the pieces move differently from one another, and one piece is more important, but that's about it. As a result, this game is played on a 6x6 board and the movement of every piece has changed (other than the General, which moves as a King). \"Design conceit\" aside, I wrote the game because I had built a very beautiful 6x6 physical board and pieces, and just wanted something different to play on it. I made the pieces visually unique because playing it with Chess pieces is mildly confusing (though it can be done).","With a smaller board, the pieces engage much more quickly than in Chess, so there is no en-passant. Also, since Officers can step over friendly pieces at any time, there is no castling. And since movement is generally limited to a maximum of two steps, you won't generally find a lot of back-field infiltration in this game. It's very much a field of battle with a definite front, and draws are common. Since the pieces are more similar in strength than in Chess, a game tends to be either cautious dancing or a bloodbath.","As might be expected, this isn't as good as \"Earth cake\" (Chess). However, I'm tweaking the rules as gameplay, and may introduce variants in later Zillions files. I've noted a few at the end of this file that I'm playtesting. So far I particularly like \"Pyrrhic Victory\".","It's named \"Lyra\" merely because I like the name.","WINNING CONDITION: Capture the General","GENERAL MOVEMENT:","Movement is by stepping, not sliding","Captains, Lieutenants, and some promoted Assassins can jump a friendly Soldier (see below)","An Officer can jump a friendly piece","The General must avoid moving into check","There is no en-passant","There is no castling","GENERAL CAPTURES:","Officers capture by replacement","All pieces capture in the direction of movement","An Assassin promotes upon capturing an opposing piece (see below)","PIECES:","In ascending order of rank:","Soldier  - Moves and captures 1 space orthogonally forward or to the side - On reaching the last rank, promotes to a Lieutenant","Lieutenant  - Moves 1 or two spaces diagonally, or one space north/south - Does not promote","Captain  - Moves 1 or two spaces orthoganally, or one space diagonally forward - Does not promote","Assassin   - Moves 1 spaces diagonally or 1 space side-to-side - When it captures an opposing piece, it ALSO gains the movement of that piece It only retains the movement of itself and the LAST PIECE IT CAPTURED","(the piece is held to indicate the new movement) - When it subsequently captures another opposing piece, only the movement of the last captured piece is added to its own","General  - Moves as a chess king: 1 space, any direction - Does not promote","PHYSICAL BOARD VARIANTS:","Officers can only step over lower-ranking friendly pieces","An Assassin accumulates powers of movement.

This is modeled after how magnets work,                 with opposite poles attracting and like poles repelling each other.                 With the exception of Kings, when any piece moves, it attracts or                 repels each of its closest rook-wise neighbors. Enemy pieces get                 drawn to adjacent squares, and friendly pieces get pushed out as                 far they can go. This regularly rearranges the board, provides a                 new way to promote Pawns, and creates new kinds of tactics. Joao                 Neto has also created three other variants based on the idea of                 pieces attracting and/or repelling each other. In Anti-Magnetic                 Chess, like attracts like, and opposites repel. In Gravity Chess,                 pieces attract each other, and in Anti-Gravity Chess, pieces repel                 each other. ZRF files for all four games are bundled together in                 one zip file.                 The                 pieces are made from Armando Marroquin's Chess Magnetic font. The                 image below comes from a game in which the computer played Black                 and had a thinking time of only one second. It is White's turn to                 move. Can White keep his King safe by taking the Queen? No. It will                 pull the Knight down, and the Black Knight will then take the White                 King. So you can see that Zillions plays this game very well. You                 should also notice that the position here is actually impossible                 in regular Chess, since some Pawns have been pushed to spaces they                 could not occupy in regular Chess.

The game of Sittyuin is its Burmese cousin, although not nearly so widespread as Makruk.  As these games are somewhat closely related, I have included both of them in this module.","These ZRF files are largely revamped versions of the Thai and Burmese Chess ZRF files that are included with Zillions of Games.  The main weakness with these versions, I found, was that it used [images of] Staunton chess pieces.  Considering that in both Makruk and Sittuyin the \"queen\" is a weak piece and the \"bishops\" are only marginally stronger, it was often confusing to have such weak pieces represented by larger graphics. I therefore use more appropriate graphics, mostly from Makruk software from Thailand.  I have also included some more chess-like pieces too, for those that want them.","I have also changed the Sittuyin ZRF to include each player's considerable freedom in setting up all pieces other than pawns.  To start play, each player has the pawns on the board and all other pieces off to their right, ready to distribute on the board.  White and then Black arrange their pieces behind their lines of pawns, with some restrictions, before White makes the first move proper of the game.","Included with the Makruk ZRF are three variants with first-turn-only improved powers for the King, Guard or both.

This piece can hit an enemy piece in the forward direction, provided that any intermediate squares are empty. If there is no enemy piece then the catapulted piece lands on the remotest square in a series of empty spaces. Thus the Mangonel can be used for transporting friendly pieces, attacking enemy pieces, or removing enemy pieces from good positions. This is a new and versatile weapon on the chessboard. Pawns can be catapulted to their promotion square, when they are promoted to queen as only alternative. Pawns cannot be catapulted to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit.

If not, the piece cannot be dropped on the friendly pawn. The two bishops must be dropped on different colours. Castling can be performed with a rook on a corner square. Note that pieces and pawns are allowed to move before all pieces have been dropped.","Since the pawns are placed on the board from the start, the dropping phase is shorter than in other drop variants. Thanks to the pawn relocation procedure, there is great freedom in the placement of the pawns, anyway.

A complete set of Millennium 3D Chess rules can be downloaded from: http://webspace.webring.com/people/pm/millennium3dchess/  KNIGHT: The Knight moves in a 'L' shaped manner which can be described as moving two squares along a row and one square along a column, or visa versa. The Knight can also change one level and move two squares, or change two levels and move one square.  BISPHOP: The Bishop moves diagonally as well as along a sloping direction following a diagonal. A 'sloping' move is defined as moving both one square and changing one level -- or -- moving two squares and changing two levels. A Bishop cannot move vertically straight up nor down.  ROOK: The Rook can move along any row or column, and the Rook may also move vertically up or down as well along a sloping direction following any row or column.  QUEEN: The Queen can move along any row or column, move along any diagonal, move vertically up or down, and move along a sloping direction following any column, row or diagonal.  KING: The King can move one square in any direction, change one level, or move one square in any direction and change one level. The King can never be moved into 'check'.  PAWN: A Pawn can move straight ahead one square, change one level up or down, or move both one square forward and change one level. On a Pawn's first move, a Pawn can move two squares straight ahead, change two levels, or move both two squares forward and change two levels in a sloping direction. A Pawn cannot advance directly into an occupied square. A Pawn can only capture an opposing chess piece by moving one square along a forward diagonal or along a forward sloping diagonal. When a Pawn reaches the starting row and level of the opposing King, then the Pawn is immediately promoted to either a Queen, Rook, Bishop or Knight.  The author wishes to thank L.

The object is to checkmate the opponent's General by attacking it so that it has no safe positions to move to. It's also a win to stalemate your opponent so that he can't move -- this usually only happens when a player is reduced to a lone king. A player may not force a repetition of moves. Generals cannot face each other on a file with no intervening pieces. The 3x3 boxes at the top and bottom of the board are the Generals' imperial palaces or fortresses. The Generals may not leave their fortresses. Right-click on the pieces to see how they move. Chariots are the most valuable pieces. The Horse is less valuable than the Cannon in the opening, but becomes stronger as the game progresses. The Cannons are effective positioned behind friendly pawns. MiniXiangqi was introduced by S. Kusumoto, in 1973. There exists a MiniXiangqi federation in Japan. Four game examples are provided.","Endgames properties: A lone General can be mated (remember that checkmate and stalemate both win, and Generals cannot face each other a file with no intervening pieces) by General and Soldier, General and Horse, or General and Chariot.","Soldier/Pawn (zu/tsut, bing/ping = foot soldier)  Soldiers can move forward left and right, immediately from the beginning (unlike in normal Xiangqi).","Horse/Knight (ma = horse) Horses move like a Knight in Chess, except that they can't jump over other pieces. They step outward on a row or column, then diagonally outward one step. If something is adjacent to a Horse on a row or column, it can't move in that direction.","Chariot/Rook (ju/kui = chariot) Chariots move like the Rook in Western Chess, that is, any number of squares along a row or column. The Chariots are initially positioned in the corners.","Cannon (pao = cannon) Cannons move like Chariots/Rooks, by sliding any number of squares along a row or column, but they can capture an enemy only if there is another piece (of either side) in between. Thus to capture they leap over the intervening piece and land on the enemy piece, like a cannonball. One account of Xiangqi dates the introduction of the cannon at 839 A.D.","General/King (jiang/cheung = general, shuai/sui = general) The General is confined to the fortress and can only move a step at a time horizontally or vertically. It also has the special power to threaten an enemy General across the board along an open column. For this reason, it is not permitted to make a move that leaves the two Generals facing each other with nothing in between. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's General.

The Soldier promotes, optionally, when moving up to the 6th or 7th rank.","MiniXiangqi can also be played with two Leopards each, positioned at b1/b7, f1/f7, with the Cannons before them at the second rank.

The method generates 57 different positions, all non-mirrored (except the standard position). The players in turn swap, firstly, the king, secondly, the queen. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. Knights and rooks cannot be swapped. The bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen).","Black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can forgo this possibility (by pressing the king). While the turn is still with Black, he now has the option to relocate his queen. White may not relocate his queen so that a mirrored position occurs. When White has made his king + queen swap (or dispensed with this possibility) he immediately starts the game by making the first move. Note that it is possible for the king to swap with the kingside bishop, but this necessitates that the queen be swapped with one of the bishops so that the bishops end up on different colours.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules are simple and derive from Chess960. King and rook end up on their usual squares. The only difference is that the king can make longer leaps than usual (or shorter, or none at all). All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened. Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","With these relocation rules the rooks remain in their natural positions, and the bishops are always positioned so that there is still a choice to develop them on either of the queenside or the kingside. The knights are ready to immediately attack in the centre. This maintains the strategical ambiguity of the initial position. All positions are non-mirrored. This ensures that there exists a strategical tension, which makes games interesting. Black relocates first. White should command the game, and in this way he can take command of the strategical situation. The most conservative relocation, it seems, is to change place between king and queen, which is a convenient way of avoiding theory. Remember that the resultant castling positions are always the same as in standard chess."],"image":"game1807_scr_Multi-chess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":6}

(It is not allowed to jump over an enemy piece.) Capture is not mandatory. A soldier is prohibited from capturing a king. You win by checkmating or stalemating your opponent's King.","Nam Dinh uses the same board pattern as the medieval European game Alquerque. The source for the game is a Czech book by Zapletal (1991). According to an article in Variant Chess, 61, 2009, Zapletal bases his description on information from someone called Z. Hartmann who had seen the game played by natives of Nam Dinh, a province in the Red River Delta region of northern Vietnam. Accordingly, I have chosen the name Nam Dinh for this game, because I don't know the native name. It has also been denoted Vietnamese Chess, but this is improper since there is really no relation to chess. Vietnamese Chess is actually the name of a Xiangqi variant.","This new implementation of Nam Dinh uses the better understood rules, as clarified by Robert Reid. The earlier rules are based on a misunderstanding. It is said that the soldiers cannot capture. But this renders a game that is boring, since it is all about shuffling pieces. What's worse, it is a win for the first party in two moves: 1.Sd2-c3 Kc5xe3 2.Sd1-d2 checkmate! (Due to the fact that the soldiers cannot capture they are unable to move after black's first move, and the king is forced into a checkmate.)","The correct rule is this: the soldiers cannot capture a king. It seems likely that the two last words have simply been dropped in the faulty rendition. This renders a fine game that demands great skill. It does not appear to be drawish, although non-trivial endgames with 3 versus 3 pieces should be regarded a draw. The privileged king rule also appears in Italian Damone and the Sámi Dablo games (Dablo Daares, etc.), which have also been implemented in Zillions.","References: Zapletal, Miloš (1991).

The game is played on both the outside and inside of a soccer ball, with the 12 pentagons serving as \"gateways\" between the two sides.  Along with the 12 pentagons, there are 40 hexagons - 20 on each side, making 52 cells altogether.","Players of ALICE CHESS with recognize the similarities - it's like having two boards, with pieces able to move from one to the other.","The name and the idea come from C.S. Lewis's novels, \"Chronicles of Narnia\".  Remember the wardrobe?  and the magic picture frame?  These and other \"gateways\" allowed passage from Earth to Narnia.  One could also recall Jack L. Chalker's \"Wellworld\" science-fiction novels : there was a gateway at the pole of many planets, allowing people to travel to the Wellworld.  The pentagons in this game serve a similar purpose.","In the initial setup, all of the pieces have Pawns or Guards on top of them. The Pawns or Guards must move off before the pieces can move. You can do that by clicking on the cell where you want the Pawn or Guard to move. You *cannot* move a piece until the Pawn or Guard on top of it has moved off first.","The King begins the game off-board. The first move of the game is to \"crown\" on of your other pieces, making it royal.

Bundled with the ZIP file are graphics demonstrating the movements.","KING - this piece is inspired by the Goal in Klinzha. The King, who begins the game off- board, has no movement powers of his own (except on the first move of the game) and must be carried by another piece. The first move of the game is, therefore, to move the King on top of the piece that will carry him. The Zillions version treats the King and the piece carrying him as a single piece. The ROYAL ROOK, ROYAL BISHOP, ROYAL KNIGHT, ROYAL RINGMASTER, ROYAL SATELLITE, and ROYAL WIZARD are the resulting pieces. Each royal piece retains the movement capabilities of its simple form, but may not move into or through check.","ROOK - rides any number of cell along a straight path between two pentagons.  The Rook may cross over from one surface of the board to the other, and back again.","BISHOP - rides in diagonal loops - defined as hexagonal cells connected by a line between two other cells. Players of many hexagonal chess variants will recognize this piece.  Each Bishop is confined to one surface of the board; it cannot cross over to the other side.","WIZARD - rides in pentagonal loops - defined as pentagonal cells connected by a line between two hexagonal cells. The Wizard moves on pentagons much as the Bishop does on hexagons, and was inspired by the hexagonal bishop. As a pentagonal piece, the Wizard is simultaneously on both surfaces of the board.  In this version, unlike the original Chess on a Soccer Board, one Wizard may not attack another.  This is because in the initial setup of the Symmetrical Version, each wizard is in position to attack another, and White could capture a Black Wizard on its first move if allowed to do so.  This would, in my opinion, give White an unfair advantage.","KNIGHT - leaps (a) from one hexagon to another hexagon three cells away, (b) from a hexagon to a pentagon three cells away, or (c) from a pentagon to a hexagon three cells away.  The Knight may cross over from one surface of the board to the other, and back again.","RINGMASTER - rides in hexagonal loops around a single pentagon. As each hexagon is adjacent to three pentagons, a Ringmaster may move in any one of three directions. Each Ringmaster is confined to one surface of the board; it cannot cross over to the other side.","SATELLITE - rides in crooked hexagonal loops around \"equators\", i.e., paths that divide the board equally in two. Each \"equator\" consists of ten hexagons and has five hexagons and six pentagons on either side of it. Each Satellite is confined to one surface of the board; it cannot cross over to the other side.","PAWN - moves one cell without capturing on hexagons, or captures by moving one cell from a hexagon to a pentagon, on which it morphs into a Guard. The Pawn, unlike its FIDE counterpart, may move backward or sideways as well as forwards. At the beginning of the game, every Pawn stands on top of another piece and must move off before that piece can move. The Pawn may not attack a royal piece (i.e., a piece carrying the King).  By changing into a Guard, a Pawn may cross over to the other surface of the board.","GUARD - moves one cell without capturing on pentagons, or captures by moving one cell from a pentagon to a hexagon, on which it morphs into a Pawn.

NOTE : if you are playing Zillions, the yellow and red pieces in the initial setup are really white and black pieces, respectively, with Pawns or Guards on them. When the Pawn or Guard moves off, the piece left behind will change colour.","ROYAL PIECES - ordinary pieces that are carrying a King. In Zillions, when the King mounts a piece, a crown appears above it.","HOW TO PLAY","The game begins by moving the King on top of the piece that will carry him. Any piece in the initial setup may be chosen.","Next, start moving Pawns and Guards off pieces. In the Zillions implementation, you will get an error message if you try to move a piece with a Pawn or Guard on top of it - \"Sorry, that piece cannot move now.\" Choose a piece, and click your mouse on the cell where you want the Pawn or Guard to move. It will move off, leaving the piece behind - which will change colour (yellow to white, red to black).","Pawns and Guards *may not* give check to a royal piece. You may well ask why not.

Frankly, I don't find \"fool's mate\" much fun - I like games to last a little while.

This variant uses the same set up, and while","it also engages players faster into capturing, its intention is different.","The purpose of Near Chess is to be one of the fastest ways to introduce","people to chess, and the world of chess variants, without being trivial to","those who play it still.  Near Chess expands upon the pawn simplification","of Skirmish Chess, and removes rules from regular chess that aren't needed","and also makes it harder for new players to learn.  The end result is a","game that can be taught quickly to newbies, and get them playing faster.","SETUP","It is the same as in Skirmish Chess: White's back rank is empty and White's chessmen are moved up to the third","rank (pawns) and the second rank (non-pawns); Black's chessmen are","similarly arrayed, with pawns on the sixth rank and non-pawns on the","seventh rank. Pawns do not have a double-step option on their first move.","RULES","Same as in standard FIDE Chess, except for the set-up and these rules which","have been removed or changed:","Pawns only move one space forward and capture one space diagonally.","There is also no En Passant.  This is because pawns start forward.","There is no castling.","Game is won by capturing the opponent's king, rather than checkmating","it.  This eliminates stalemate.","Pieces only promote to those pieces that have been captured, except a","pawn.  In other words, the player is limited to only one queen, two rooks,","two knights, etc... A pawn is not permitted to move into the back row,","unless it is able to be promoted to some other pieces, besides another","pawn.","NOTES","When all the pieces got shifted forward one space, it became apparent that","had chess taken this route in its development after the Mad Queen was","introduced, all the more complicated rules introduced to make chess work","would likely of never came into being.  These change, while simplifying","chess, hardly makes it more trivial.  As players play this, they will find","that they do more positioning behind their pawns, rather than in front of","them.

Besides normal castling one can choose to move the king three squares instead of two. The rook ends up on its usual square. The corner square provides a hiding nest for the king should the player want to invoke play on the same wing and advance with the pawns. The extended castle rule also makes play on the wings easier to achieve. Queenside castle becomes more attractive.

The piece is automatically introduced at the position that is first left vacant when a piece leaves its initial square. The piece that first moves will also bring the external piece into play, so it is a double-move, comparable to castling.","Neoteric Chess is a relocation variant. Black can decide the initial positions of the kings, and White can then decide the initial positions of the queens. The positions must mirror each other. Neoteric Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the king + queen and another piece. The king may not swap with any of the rooks. The queen can be swapped with one of the rooks provided that the king remains between the rooks (this is a requirement of Chess960).","Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the kings thus have been swapped the turn is still with white. White can now relocate the queen, if he so wishes, and black then mirrors this. Next white starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules are simple and derive from Chess960. King and rook end up on their usual squares. The only difference is that the king can make longer leaps than usual (or shorter, or none at all). All squares between king and rook must be empty and unthreatened. NOTE! If the King starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the Rook instead of the King.","With these relocation rules the bishops are always positioned so that there is still a choice to develop them on either of the queen's or the king's wing. There is at least one rook in its standard position. This maintains the strategical ambiguity of the initial position, while sound positions are produced where no definitive advantage can be obtained. Black relocates first. Thusly white gets a chance to make a strategical decision and create an initiative, as in the standard position. The possible twentyfive initial positions are a subgroup of Fischer Random Chess. The most conservative relocation, it seems, is to change place between king and queen, which is a convenient way of avoiding theory. Remember that the resultant castling positions are always the same as in standard chess. The standard position is included as an option.","This implementation will allow the user to test which pieces are suitable. It will be enhanced with more alternative pieces in later editions. Neoteric Chess is a relocation variant, designed to overcome the problem of opening monotony. Arguably, this method of reconfiguration of the initial array makes the procedure of Fischer randomization redundant. It also answers to the chessplayer's predilection for remaining in control.","So far, these pieces have been implemented: Swedish Cannon, Chancellor, Archbishop, Amazon, Mastodon, Dimachaer, Trebuchet, Kwagga, Divaricator, Murmillo, Culverin, Belfry, Adjutant and Zeppelin, Consul, Dragonet, Camel (3+1), Llama, Alpaca, Guanaco, and Vicuña."],"image":"game1897_scr_NeotericChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":22}

A band of villagers has risen up, grabbed their torches and pitchforks and sharpened their wooden stakes to confront this menace. Unfortunately, any villager attacked by Nosferatu does not truly die but rather becomes a vampire under his control. The only hope the villagers have of stopping this ever growing army of the undead is to slay the head vampire, Nosferatu.","OBJECTIVE: For the Vampires, it is to eliminate all the Villagers. For the Villagers, it is to capture Nosferatu.","ACTIONS: A 'move' consists of one of three types of actions: Entering, Attacking, or Moving. An attacking move must be made whenever possible; when no attack is available, entering takes precedence over moving.","ENTERING: The board starts off empty. The Vampires have six pieces, consisting of Nosferatu plus 5 Vampires.  The Villagers have 12 Men.  The Vampire player begins and places one of his pieces on any space on the board, except for the central hex. (Note: there is no particular order that the Nosferatu piece needs to be entered. It can be the player's first piece or his last, or anywhere in-between.) The players then alternate turns, placing their pieces on any open space on the board, with the restriction that a piece may not placed in any space that can come under immediate attack by an opponent's piece. The players must enter all their pieces on the board before they are allowed to move any of them. Thus the Vampires, who have half as many pieces as the Villagers, will usually begin moving first.","ATTACKING: Both Villagers and Vampires make captures as in Checkers, jumping over an opponent's piece to the empty space just beyond and continuing to jump and capture as long as it is possible. Jumps may be done in any of the six directions defined by a row of hexes.","Nosferatu, with his ability to change into a bat and fly, has far greater maneuverability than any other piece in the game. He may travel over any number of empty hexes on either side of a jump. Like the rest of the pieces, if he can continue jumping he must do so. When Nosferatu attacks a Villager, he has the choice of removing them from the board or having them remain in their position and be converted into Vampires.","Since we are dealing here with a bunch of bloodthirsty vampires and riotous villagers, all attacks are compulsory. Attacking takes precedence over any other action, including entering a piece. When given a choice of attacks, a player need not choose the move that results in the greatest possible number of attacks.","MOVING: A player may move a piece only when he has no more pieces to enter onto the board and when he has no attacks to make. Moving for both Vampires and Villagers consist simply of stepping onto an adjacent, empty cell.","Again, Nosferatu can fly as a bat, and so travel farther then the rest of the pieces.

Win is achieved by capturing the opponent's king. The players have the same pieces as in Shatranj, namely a king that moves one square in any direction; a general (firzan) that moves diagonally one step; two fils that jump diagonally two steps; two knights that move like chess knights; two rooks (rukh) that correspond to chess rooks, and eight pawns that move like chess pawns, except that there is no initial double-step. The today uncommon pieces general and fil have been marked with a red spot to remind the player that they move in the medieval manner. These medieval pieces are better suited for this game than modern chess pieces.","The die decides which piece can be moved. Click on the die to throw it. When rolling a six, the player may move the king, when rolling a five, the player may move the general, when rolling a four, the player may move a fil, when rolling a three, the player may move a knight, when rolling a two, the player may move a rook, and when rolling a one, the player may move a pawn.

If you want to (or must) pass a move, then you must signal this by lifting and dropping the king. Note that you are obliged to perform this procedure even if the die shows the number of a piece that you don't own anymore.

Octa-Ashtapada is an attempt to create a robust and enjoyable, though maybe aggravating,  game for this field.","First, the introduction of several new 3D Chess pieces: Amazon, Cardinal, Herald, Marshall and Prince.   The Amazon, Cardinal and Marshall have their origin in 2D Chess variant.  They, along with the Herald  which is unique to 3D Chess, combine the powerful slides with the Space Knight leap.  The Prince, having  its origin in Shogi, offers a new area of contention with its ability to become another King.","Next, the adjustment to the end-game condition.  Rather than checkmating the King, the player must capture  it.  With the promotion of the Prince, this can create several goals for the opponent.  So, promotion of  the Prince will offer a great advantage.  Thus, it is not necessary for the player to either avoiding or  remove a threat on a King.  Of course, it would be foolish to leave or place a solitary King in jeopardy.","The game will often begin with a battle between the various leaping power pieces.  Do not be squeamish.   Think of this part as the \"Battle of the Titans\".  The wall of Pawns will give you some protection, as  long as they are defended.  Be willing to sacrifice a non-sliding leaper for a sliding leaper.  This  portion of the game could last about 100 turns.  But a mistake by an opponent during this phase could  result in an early win.","After this first phase, the player might concentrate on seperating their King and Prince, while attempting  to remove the opponent's surviving Prince and promote their own.","A player having several Kings will greatly influence the opponent's strategy and overall structure of the  game.  With Pawns being able to promote to the Prince, the player has the option of introducing numerous  possible Kings to the field, thus creating further complications for the opponent.

The most interesting of these was Optima, a game in which players used 10 pieces chosen from a pool of 20, ensuring that each game was different and that relative piece values were not necessarily constant.  When the program Zillions-of-Games came out, I realized that I finally had a chance to playtest Optima.  In the process of learning Zillions language and implementing Optima, I revised the rules, adding new pieces to the pool and balancing the game by adding guards, a unit intermediate in power between pawns and pieces.  The result, I hope, is a game that is both tactical and positional, with difficult and interesting decisions regarding piece exchanges, and virtually infinite in its combinational possibilities.  But all of that, of course, is for the players to judge.","Board:  Optima is played on a checkered board 10 squares wide and 10 squares deep.","Goal:  To win, a player must checkmate or stalemate the opposing king.  A threefold repetition of a given position is a draw.","Initial Position:  Each player has 10 pawns on his third rank, 10 guards on his second rank, and 10 pieces, one of which is the king, off the board.","Piece sets:  In the equal-forces game, each player has the same 10 pieces, one of which is the king.  In the unequal-forces game, each player has a king, and 18 additional pieces are selected and form a \"pool\" belonging to both players until the placement phase is complete.","Placement:  Equal-forces: starting with white, each player in turn places one of his pieces on his first rank until it is full.  White then makes the first move of the movement phase.  Unequal-forces: All placement is to each player's first rank.  White places his king.  Black then places his king and selects and places one piece from the pool.  Players then alternate placing two pieces from those remaining in the pool.  Placement ends with white placing the last remaining piece and then making the first move of the movement phase.","Pawns:  By default, pawns move one or two squares in the four orthogonal directions, and capture one square in the four diagonal directions.  A pawn that reaches the 10th rank must promote to a Wizard, which is the most powerful piece in the game and is only available by pawn promotion.  Players who wish to use other pawn rules may, by agreement, change to another of the allowed pawn definitions.   To do this in Zillions, they will have to manually edit the zrf file.","Guards:  By default, a guard moves and captures one or two squares in any direction.  Guards do not promote.

If a pawn can move forwards to a square occupied by a piece of any colour, then the pawn and the piece can change place, also at the pawn's double-step. Exceptions are the king, and the friendly pawn, which cannot be displaced. Thusly, only kings and friendly pawns are capable of blocking a pawn. Should the pawn move to a piece placed on the last rank, then the pawn will be promoted to queen, without options. Otherwise regular rules apply.","While both pawns and pieces are affected by the swapping move, the relative values of pawns and pieces remain largely the same, although the pawn is slightly stronger. Although the pawn, in a sense, is stronger, it is also more vulnerable, while it has lost its blocking capability. Blocking an enemy pawn with a piece is now less efficient. The pawn's swapping move can be used to maneuver the pieces to better squares. There is also a more conservative variant where neither the kings nor the pawns, of any colour, are swappable. Phalanx Chess was invented and implemented by undersigned, August 2007. The primary piece graphics was created by P. Wong, Australia.","Phalanx: in military science, tactical formation consisting of a block of heavily armed infantry standing shoulder to shoulder in files several ranks deep. Fully developed by the ancient Greeks, it survived in modified form into the gunpowder era and is viewed today as the beginning of European military development (Enc.

The game was described by his student in 1890. It is similar to Anglo-Saxons checkers although it is played on a 9x9 board. Although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line (i.e. it is not necessary to choose the series of jumps that captures the most men). Philosophy Shogi Checkers is an attractive game; Anglo-Saxons checkers with a twist. It still revolves around acquiring material advantage, because the King cannot easily be attacked, unless it ventures out on the board in the middlegame.","The object is to capture the opponent's King, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can move forward, by sliding diagonally to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in any direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a Prince and can then move and capture forwards and backwards. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. The King moves and captures like the Prince.","Philosophy Shogi Checkers never ends in a draw (except by repetition), because there is no \"double corner\" where the King can go back and forth. Thus all King vs. King endgames are won. By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage generally leads to a win. A good strategy is to try and get the first Prince, because this piece will cause a lot of damage to the opponent, provided he cannot capture the Prince quickly. Try to hinder the opponent from getting a Prince, by keeping your lines closed so that he cannot break through. The King, together with the guardians on the adjacent squares, should remain in place until a later phase of the game. Thus, both the King and the promotion squares are protected.","I have invented a variant named \"Philosophy Checkers\" where the pieces may also capture orthogonally, as in Frisian draughts. This vouches for a much more combinatorial game. In this dynamic variant, a Man moves diagonally forward one step at a time. It can capture in all eight directions. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capture is mandatory, and one must always choose the line that captures the most pieces. The captured pieces remain on the board until the capture sequence is finished.","In this new variant, a Prince is a very powerful piece that can slide diagonally over empty squares and make \"long\" captures over empty squares, in all diagonal and orthogonal directions. It may also slide orthogonally, but on the dark colour squares only. (Thus, it is the same piece as the Dame in Scandinavian draughts.) Unlike the Man, it needn't land on the first empty square behind the captured piece. When making an orthogonal jump-capture, the capturing piece may only land on dark squares, while the other colour squares are neglected. Enemy pieces are captured one at a time, but several in sequence, if the position so allows. If the Man lands on a promotion square during a capture sequence, it does not promote. The King is the weakest piece. It moves and captures as in Anglo-Saxon checkers, diagonally forwards and backwards. The objective of the game is to capture the King.","Inoue Enryô (March 18, 1858 - June 6, 1919), Japanese philosopher, Buddhist reformer, educator, and nationalist; A key figure in the reception of Western philosophy, the emergence of modern Buddhism, and the permeation of the imperial ideology during the Meiji era. He is the founder of Toyo University and created the Temple Garden of Philosophy in Tokyo (cf.

When it takes, it must jump: when taking, the Cannon also moves over an orthogonal line, jumps over the first piece it meets (which may either be friendly or from the opponent) and then continues over the line until the next piece it sees: if that is from the opponent, the Cannon can take it by moving to that position.","Vao - When it isn't capturing, it moves like a Bishop; when it does capture, it moves diagonally like a Bishop, except that it must jump over a single intervening piece, which may belong to any player. It moves like a Bishop until it reaches this piece, leaps over it, and continues moving like a Bishop until it captures its target. When it isn't capturing, it may not leap; and it may not capture without leaping.","Super Pawn - The Super Pawn can move 1 space or jump 2 spaces: sideways or diagonally forward or straight ahead. (E,W,NE,NW,N)  Note that like a regular pawn it cannot go backwards. Unlike, normal pawns, it captures by replacement while making any of its moves. Jumped over enemy pieces are unaffected. En-passant rules do not apply, and it promotes to any piece just like a regular pawn.","Fast Pawn - The pawn's move is modified slightly to make it stronger and faster. The pawn can move 1 or 2 spaces forward anytime. It cannot jump and like a normal pawn it captures diagonally NE NW only. A pawn can capture en-passant an enemy pawn that made a double space move to bypass it.","Flexible Castling: The game utilizes flexible castling, which enables the king and rook to choose from 7 castling positions. The king and rook must be adjacent to each other after castling and the king cannot be in check or pass over attacked squares during castling.","Castling can be done by moving the king 1-3 (or 4 on Q-side) spaces towards the rook and moving the rook over and next to it. The most extreme wing castling occurs with the king moving 3 spaces (or 4 spaces on q-side) to the rook's square while the rook moves 1 space towards the king. Conversely the most centralized rook castling involves the king moving just 1 space words the rook and the rook filling the king's square. The choice of castling positions depends on whether a centralized rook or a king tucked away at the wing is more desired.","Note that while there are more castling options in this game, there are also more opportunities to not castle at all!

The positions must mirror each other. Placement Chess is like standard chess except that the players can, before play begins, swap places of the king + queen and another piece except the rooks. Thus, when the king is swapped (relocated), the other piece (the relocatee) ends up on the king's square. When the queen is swapped, the relocatee ends up on the queen's square. One restriction is that the bishops mustn't end up on the same square colour, and the king cannot become a relocatee (i.e. swapped by the queen). Note that black begins by swapping his king. Alternatively he can choose to leave the position as it is (by pressing the king). The white player then mirrors black's swap. After the kings thus have been swapped the turn is still with white. White can now relocate the queen, if he so wishes, and black then mirrors this. Next white starts the game by making the first move.","Note that the king retains his castling rights even if it has been relocated. The castling rules derive from Fischer Random Chess. White castles in the following way (the Black procedure is equivalent). When castling left (O-O-O) , the king moves to c1 and the rook moves to d1. When castling right (O-O) the king moves to g1 and the rook moves to f1. The following conditions must be true: the king must not move to, from or over an attacked square; the king and rook have never moved; there is no other piece on any square over which the king and rook move. Note! If the king starts the game on a castling destination square (c or g), castling on that side is done by moving the rook instead of the king.","Curtailed castling: in an alternative variant, if the king is positioned on the g or b file, castling is restricted to the side on which the king is positioned. The variant could be useful to enhance strategical predictability."],"image":"game1711_scr_PlacementChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":9}

The game board is cut down to a fraction of its original dimensions: a mere 6x8 board with 2 escape squares only available for the king - a total of 46 squares. There exists an underlying logic in this seemingly bizarre start position. There is no castling for the king is already at a wing (in the palace), and the objective of the game is not just checkmate (which wins as usual), but to escape the prison with your king by fleeing to the escape zone! The escape squares do not hinder the movement of any pieces.","For full details of the moves please see: https://chess.computerwebservices.net/prison.php","or search for game at chessvariants.org","The rules are as in orthodox chess except as noted below:","Pawns promote on the last rank to Ice-Queen Ninja-Guard,Flying Bomber or knight. Ice Queen will freeze opposing king rendering it unable to move thus it is checkmate!! - Unless there is an adjacent ice queen that makes it an icicle! In this case the king will be frozen but not checkmated! Try it out by playing both sides and moving the 2 enemy queens next to each other with the king in the vicinity.","The Ninja Guard's Moves ------------------------ The Ninja Guard is a color bound piece that can move one or two steps diagonally. It can leap over a diagonally adjacent friendly piece to land exactly 2 squares away (a two-space diagonal leap). It can capture on any square it lands, and additionally it can can capture an enemy piece that is diagonally adjacent by jumping over it. It can capture two pieces (the first immediately adjacent to it, and the next right after) in its path on a diagonal by jumping over the first one and capturing the second piece on the square it lands.","The Extra-mobile sliding pawn ------------------------------ The pawn moves and captures exactly as in orthodox chess except for the following. Normally, when a pawn faces an opposing pawn or an enemy piece, the pawn is blocked. However, the sliding pawn can, under these circumstances only if it is blocked, slide pass the enemy piece or pawn with the same 1-step diagonal movement that it would make when capturing.","The Ice Queen ---------------- Ice Queen can move to any adjacent square, capturing if possible and freezing all pieces around it! It steps/captures 1 square in any direction and Freezes all pieces it comes into contact with.  Note that if ice queen steps next to an enemy ice queen, it loses all freeze power, and becomes an icicle! Do not step in front of enemy queen! Note that the enemy ice queen should not try to move around or else they will both simultaneously freeze. Best to capture the icicle - be careful and never let an enemy ice q that stepped in front of yours reactivate.","The Flying Bomber's Moves ----------------------------------- The flying bomber's odd combination of long-range and short-range moves makes it a deadly weapon against an unsuspecting opponent.","Standard Move:","The flying bomber eliminates an enemy piece by flying over it, and landing on THE empty square immediately after it on the same orthogonal line. It cannot fly over or capture a second piece or land on any square beyond the first empty square.","The flying bomber can fly along any amount of empty squares (1-9) orthogonally, but not over any friendly pieces. This is identical to the movement of a rook.","For a successful bombing, there must be an empty square immediately after the first enemy piece on the same line.","Special Move: the Helicopter Landing","This is a special maneuver that enables the flying bomber to fly over the adjacent square, (jumping over, if occupied by friendly piece or eliminating if occupied by enemy piece) and land like a helicopter on a square exactly 2 squares away, capturing if possible on this square. It can capture two pieces in this manner.","Essentially, it combines its standard move with that of a two space orthogonal jumper."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[32,12],"variations":0}

It captures on the second leg only. The Provocator can also move by colliding against the margin, whereby only one movement direction is available after collision. Without screens to collide against the Provocator cannot move. The Provocator's value is the same as a knight or bishop (preliminary estimate). Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Provocator. As it can move only by coordinating with another piece, the Provocator is a highly cooperative piece, something which makes it interesting to the positional player. The structure on the board decides its possibilities. The Provocator has the interesting capacity of zigzaging between the pieces in the middlegame. The Provocator loses less power in the endgame than one would expect. Although screens for colliding become fewer, its scope and mobility also increases.","Provocator Chess can also be played with Kwaggas instead of knights. The Kwagga moves like an extended knight, three squares orthogonally plus one step to the side. It can multiply this jump in the same direction. This means that the Kwagga moves like a Camelrider. However, unlike the Camelrider, the Kwagga can only capture on the first jump, and the next square must be empty. The Kwagga is as valuable as a bishop (my estimate).

This changes game dynamics a lot, since now pieces can be returned to board, but at the cost of iniciative. Sometimes positions will be simplified, sometimes not. On board maneuver will be more valorized, but drops will still have an important role. Pawns may not be dropped on the last three ranks, and promoted Pawns turn back into Pawns when they are captured.

The revised Pawn, provided that it has reached the seventh rank, can also capture forwards. Due to this, passed Pawns are now more dangerous. In Revised Chess, drawish endgames will occur less often. Many theoretical endgames that have hitherto been drawn are now won. The additional capture-capability will also have an impact in the middlegame. It will not affect opening theory at all.","This method is a surprisingly simple way of introducing extra complexity. Comparatively, in orthodox chess a pawn is easy to block. This creates the marked drawishness of practical endgames. Therefore, most chessplayers prefer to keep the queen on the board, until they have created an advantage. Players can now exchange queen and enter a practical endgame, and, unlike before, the stronger player will tend to win. This is, arguably, a significant improvement compared with orthodox chess, although much analysis is needed to establish this.

It consists of five basic pieces,  Twyk, Bleeng, Zum, Do-od and Sii.  There are two other compound pieces,  Bleeng-od and Zum-od.  All move upon the triangular points of a five-space  sided hexagonal board.   Red plays first, Yellow second and Blue third.","The TWYK is the most represented piece within the game.  It may move to  any adjacent empty space, or leap over any number of directly adjacent  pieces, regardless of owner, to land upon an empty space. The Twyk then  captures any piece, except the Do-od, which is directly between it and  another of its own Twyks. The player may capture, as a turn, any one piece  which is directly between two of their Twyks. Twyks may only be captured by  other Twyks. The Twyk is represented by the full circle.","The BLEENG uses its Twyks to move.  A player moves the Bleeng to their own  adjacent Twyk, or through directly empty spaces to their own Twyk, then the  Bleeng continues on, in the any straight direction except backwards, and  may stop upon any subsequent empty space or when a capture is made.  The  Bleeng may not capture either the Do-od or the Twyk.  If the Bleeng captures  the Bleeng-od or Zum-od, it becomes a Bleeng-od.  The Bleeng is represented  by the ring.","The ZUM moves until it either encounters the edge of the playing field or  another piece.  It may either stop directly before or upon capturing an  opponent piece.  It may not capture the Do-od or the Twyk.  If the Zum  captures the Bleeng-od or Zum-od, it becomes a Zum-od.  The Zum is represented  by the wheel.","The DO-OD may capture any opponent Bleeng or Zum, regardless of its location.   Upon making the capture of a Bleeng, the Do-od becomes a Bleeng-od.  Upon the  capture of a Zum, the Do-od becomes a Zum-od.

The Do-od, Bleeng-od and Zum-od are all recognized by the double helix pattern.","The SII moves and captures to any adjacent space.  It may make multiple capture  moves within a single turn.

It may also capture an adjacent piece by mutual capture \t(both the Swapper and the target are removed from the game). \t\t\t\t\t  The Immobilizer can not capture, but any hostile pieces next to it are \tunable to move. \t\t\t\t\t  Cannon Pawns move without capturing like Kings, and may leap over \tadjacent pieces of either side, landing just beyond, and capturing any \tpiece that might occupy the square landed in (capture by bombardment). \tOn any move that lands them on the back two ranks (counting the outer \tring), they may promote to any previously captured piece. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The Chameleon captures other pieces the way they capture, leaping over \tLong Leapers, approaching Advancers, etc.  It immobilizes opposing \tImmobilizers, and may Swap with opposing Swappers.

(If you are familiar with the piece, and wish to object that no such battle took place in it, and furthermore, Sir Ruthven didn't have any forces other than his faithful steward Adam Goodheart, well, I can't help it if G \u0026 S missed such an obvious crowd pleaser, can I?)  Ruddigore Chess is a variant of Chessgi, which in turn is a hybrid of Chess and Shogi. It is played like regular Chess except that captured pieces are put into the hand of the capturing player, and can be dropped onto the board in later turns, the King is replaced by a Baronet who also capture like a Knight and can capture friendly pieces (If a man can't capture his own pieces, whose pieces CAN he capture?), the Knights are replaced by Gentlemen, the Pawns by Quick Pawns, and there's the curse. Because of the curse, if a player does not capture a piece on an even turn (even their own piece), they must sacrifice a piece to the curse, and it is gone from the game for good.  Zillions does not play this game particularly well, but if given enough time it will play well enough to let you figure the game out. For exciting play, a human opponent is suggested.

Every ship, except the Flagship, can slide any number of spaces horizontally or vertically, like a Chess Rook. The Submarine has the additonal power of being able to dive underneath a single intervening ship of either side.  It can only do this maneuver when repositioning itself.  A Sub must remain surfaced when attacking an enemy vessel.","The different types of vessels and the way they must be attacked are:","A - Aircraft-Carrier:  [Custodianship]  An Aircraft-Carrier is a massive warship that is much too powerful to be attacked by a single ship working alone.  Instead it requires two ships working together in order to sink it.  When a move is made that surrounds an enmey Aircraft-Carrier on two opposite sides, the sandwiched ship is sunk.  This an attack by custodianship.","B - Battleship:  [Cannonade]  A Battleship is a large warship.  To sink it requires a missle strike. An enemy Battleship can only be sunk if there is another ship, of either side, in between it and the attacker.  The attacking ship leaps over the intervening vessel and lands on the enemy Battleship, like a missle.  This is just like the capturing method of the Cannon from Chinese Chess.","C - Cruiser:  [Withdrawal] A Cruiser is a medium class warship. A salvo of artillery fire is required in order to sink it.  When the attacking ship begins adjacent to the enemy Cruiser and moves away from it in a straight line, the Cruiser is fired on and sunk.  This in an attack by withdrawal.","D - Destroyer: [Leaping]  Destroyers are small, light warships that are often assigned patrol or escort duty.  They can be sunk by being rammed.  If an attacking ship runs into a Destroyer, it rams through the enemy ship to the vacant space directly behind. If the space behind the ship is occupied, then the Destroyer can not be rammed.  After ramming the Destroyer, the attacking ship may continue to sail in the same direction.  This is an attack by a long leap.","S - Submarine:  [Displacement]  A Submarine is sunk by having the attacking ship float over the submerged Sub and dropping depth charges on top of it.  The attacking ship moves to same space as the enemy Submarine.  This is an attack by displacement.","F - Flagship:  [Advancement]  The Flagship is a specially modified frigate that carries the Admiral in command of the fleet.  Instead of the usual set of armaments, the Flagship is loaded with surveilance and communications equipment.  This allows the Admiral to monitor and coordinate the battle with all the ships in the fleet.  Unfortunately, this also means that the Flagship is unable to attack any enemy vessels.  Also, the ship is weighed down with the extra equipment.  This means it can only move one space orthogonally at a time.  The Flaghship is sunk through a torpedo strike. The attacking vessel moves towards the Flagship in a straight line and stops on the space immediately before it.  This is an attack by advancement.","Multiple captures are not possible.  A vessel must concentrate fire on one ship at a time.  Also, captures are not mandatory.  So if a ship makes a move that would result in a capture, they can decide simply to reposition themselves and leave the enemy vessel on the board.  A Flagship may not be used as the second ship in the custodian capture of an Aircraft-Carrier.  A Flagship may be used as the intervening 'screen' for attack against a Battleship."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

The \"Old Man and the Sea\" is a novel written by the American author Ernest Hemingway in 1951 in Cuba, and published in 1952. The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a battle between an old, experienced fisherman and a large marlin. The novel opens with the explanation that the fisherman, who is named Santiago, has gone 84 days without catching a fish.He sets his lines and, by noon of the first day, a big fish that he is sure is a marlin takes his bait. Unable to pull in the great marlin, Santiago instead finds the fish pulling his skiff. Two days and two nights pass in this manner, during which the old man bears the tension of the line with his body. Though he is wounded by the struggle and in pain, Santiago expresses a compassionate appreciation for his adversary, often referring to him as a brother. He also determines that because of the fish's great dignity, no one will be worthy of eating the marlin. On the third day of the ordeal, the fish begins to circle the skiff, indicating his tiredness to the old man. Santiago, now completely worn out and almost in delirium, uses all the strength he has left in him to pull the fish onto its side and stab the marlin with a harpoon, ending the long battle between the old man and the tenacious fish. Santiago straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and heads home, thinking about the high price the fish will bring him at the market and how many people he will feed. While Santiago continues his journey back to the shore, sharks are attracted to the trail of blood left by the marlin in the water. The first, a great mako shark, Santiago kills with his harpoon, losing that weapon in the process. He makes a new harpoon by strapping his knife to the end of an oar to help ward off the next line of sharks; in total, five sharks are slain and many others are driven away. But the sharks keep coming, and by nightfall the sharks have almost devoured the marlin's entire carcass, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail and its head. Finally reaching the shore before dawn on the next day, Santiago struggles on the way to his shack, carrying the heavy mast on his shoulder.","2.  Inspired by greatest film. Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Peter Benchley's novel of the same name. The prototypical summer blockbuster, its release is regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history.

The work is commonly known today as The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or simply Jekyll \u0026 Hyde. It is about a London lawyer named Gabriel John Utterson who investigates strange occurrences between his old friend, Dr Henry Jekyll, and the evil Edward Hyde.","The work is commonly associated with the rare mental condition often spuriously called split personality, referred to in psychiatry as dissociative identity disorder, where within the same body there exists more than one distinct personality. In this case, there are two personalities within Dr Jekyll, one apparently good and the other evil; completely opposite levels of morality. The novella's impact is such that it has become a part of the language, with the very phrase Jekyll and Hyde coming to mean a person who is vastly different in moral character from one situation to the next.

The Elephant (Chancellor) combines the powers of a Rook and a Knight. It is comparable in strength to the Queen. The Hawk (Cardinal) combines the powers of a Bishop and a Knight. It is somewhat weaker than a Queen. These pieces are known from Capablanca's Chess.","Whenever a piece leaves its initial square, one of the extra pieces can immediately be introduced to the vacant square. So this is a double move, comparable to castling. Should a player refrain from inserting his extra pieces at these occasions, then he has forfeited his chance of introducing them. When castling, one of the extra pieces can be placed on either of the squares left vacant, namely the corner square, or the e1/e8 square.","Note! When making a move that allows you to introduce a piece, but you still want to keep it in the reserve, then you must acknowledge this by lifting and dropping the external piece. Pawns can, additonally, promote to Elephant or Hawk.","Alternative variant","I introduce an alternative variant (program SeirawanChess-alternative.zrf) where the external pieces must, in the first moves, be placed on the file on which the player intends to introduce the pieces. If, for instance, the player places the external piece behind his own queen, then the piece is automatically introduced on the queen's initial square when the queen moves away. If a piece is placed behind the king then it is also introduced at castling. The same is true if the external piece is placed behind the rook. Should a piece on the initial position be captured (exchanged), then the player has forfeited his right to introduce an external piece placed behind it.","Note! The player is not allowed to position one piece on the king file and one on the rook file. This rule will prevent him from introducing two pieces simultaneously at castling. This variant solves the problem of the bishop fianchetto mentioned above. This method of introducing external pieces is probably ideal while the strategical situation is clarified before play begins.

In Shogi, captured pieces belong to the player who takes them and may be replayed later in the game as a turn. Captured pieces may be placed on any unoccupied square, except for Pawns, which can be placed only on unoccupied squares on columns without any friendly Pawns.  This implementation of Shogi is a modification of the Shogi Script by Fergus Duniho. I have created three seperate Shogi Scripts, as follows:","Beginner's, with the notation using English names and no traditional Japanese Kanji Pieces.","Traditional Shogi Set, with letters and numbers on the board to denote the grid lables, something that is frequently done in printed Shogi material.","Large Shogi Board, with a mix of pieces that are traditional and for beginners. It's just, well, big, using larger grapics. The most important alteration I made to Mr. Duniho's Shogi Script, though, was to include handicaps. One of the nice things about Modern Shogi is that it has a well defined and workable handicap system, where the stronger player moves first, but has less pieces. The greater the difference in playing strength, the larger the handicap. I have included a total of 10 handicaps, from the small Left Lance handicap all the way to the challenging (!!) 8 Piece handicap.  And while handicaps do allow weaker players a better chance to win, they also serve as an exercise for the stronger player to practice more challenging play too.  Please note that in all the handicaps, White moves first, not Black! The rationale being that Black's first move is considered to be the removal of the pieces White shall not be using. Note too that the missing pieces will be unavailable for either side to use.  Note that one of my main reasons for creating this set of shogi scripts is so that shogi players can record their games with Zillions as well as use it for playing live games on the Internet, using handicaps."],"image":"game853_scr_Shogi_Handicaps.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,37],"variations":11}

One is for Shogi, one is for Mortal Shogi, and one is for Kamikaze Mortal Shogi. They are bundled together because they use many of the same graphics, and they should appeal to a common audience. Shogi is the Japanese form of Chess. Mortal Shogi is a new Shogi variant, created by Roberto Lavieri and Fergus Duniho, in which captured pieces demote, and captured Pawns disappear all together, allowing overall material to decrease during the game. Kamikaze Mortal Shogi is an improved version of Mortal Shogi, created by Fergus Duniho, in which captured Pawns demote to Kamikazes. Kamikazes leap two spaces forward, and they disappear upon capturing or being captured.","The Shogi ZRF is a major update to one I first wrote in 1999. It is faster, smarter, and better-looking than the Shogi ZRF that comes with Zillions of Games. The other two ZRFs are based on this ZRF. Here are the main advantages of my Shogi ZRF over ZoG's. (1) It handles drops much more efficiently. (2) Piece values have been finetuned. (3) Neither side is limited to capturing 27 pieces without dropping any, for excess captured pieces can overflow to the other side. (4) The board is flippable, and flipped piece sets are included, allowing you to play White from your own perspective. (5) Besides the graphics that come with ZoG, it includes four more piece sets and two more boards, and it lets you pick any combination of board and pieces. (6) It uses arabic numeral / roman letter coordinates instead of the arabic numeral / roman numeral coordinates used by the official Zillions script. Numeral/letter coordinates are more standard, and I personally find letters easier to identify than roman numerals.","Back in 1999, Zillions had recently debuted, and it had come with its own Shogi ZRF, but it played poorly, had poor graphics, and met with other problems too. So, on opposite sides of the globe, Steve Evans and I each began to write a new Shogi ZRF. I focused on making drops more efficient. Steve focused on fixing piece values, for ZoG's ZRF was valuing Bishops and Rooks more than their promoted counterparts. I released mine first, and instead of releasing his too, Steve told me what he was doing, and I combined our ideas together. After ZoG2 debuted in 2003, I improved the ZRF even more. I made drops somewhat more efficient by optimizing the code better. I also discovered a way to finetune piece values without adding redundant moves. I went on to make individual variants with different tunings of piece values. One tuning was based on piece values that are generally accepted among Shogi authorities. Others have been based on my own hypotheses and experiments. While extensive testing is time-consuming, what tests I have done have revealed that my ZRF plays better than ZoG's and also better than such freeware programs as Steve Evans's Shogi Variants, Glen Miner's Winshogi, and even Pauli Misikangas's Shocky 2.05. It is no match for good commercial and shareware Shogi programs, but it does come with nicer graphics and has all the user-friendliness of ZoG.","Below are reduced images of two of the graphic sets available. One shows abstract symbolic pieces on a checkered board, while the other shows single-character Japanese pieces on a marble board. Both are the same dimensions as the boards that come with Zillions. The two piece sets shown are the only sets used by Kamikaze Mortal Shogi, since they are the only two that include a Kamikaze piece. But Shogi and Mortal Shogi may use any set included with Zillions plus two other sets created by myself. One is a diagrammatic set, while the other is based on Armando Marroquin's Chess Motif font. In the symbolic set shown below, as well as in the Motif set not shown, Gold and Silver Generals are represented by alchemical symbols for Gold and Silver. These correspond to the astrological symbols for sun and moon. Most other pieces in the symbolic set are based on my Abstract set for Chess variants."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,23,34],"variations":22}

A Sissa moves as follows: in one turn, first, the Sissa moves one or more squares like a rook or a bishop, and then the Sissa moves the same number of squares like the other of the two (bishop or rook). So, the Sissa has the following options:","First, it moves a number of squares as a rook. Then it makes a corner of 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees, and then moves the same number of squares as a bishop. All squares that are passed by must be empty, i.e., a Sissa does not jump over pieces.","First, it moves a number of squares as a bishop. Then, it makes a corner of 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees, and then moves the same number of squares as a rook. Again, all squares passed by must be empty. Bishops have, in addition to their normal diagonal movement, one extra property: the bishop moves one square horizontally or vertically at the first time it moves during the game. This may be done only once, with one of the players bishops. Also, for one of the bishops of the player, the first move made with this bishop must be of this special type. This move is called conversion. Note that a player may choose which bishop he converts, but if he makes a normal move with one of his bishops, the first move made with the other bishop must be a conversion move. Note also that a player never can make more than one conversion move in a game, and a promoted bishop does not make conversion moves. It is possible to take a piece of the opponent by conversion.  I don't know the castling roles of Sissa. So I have taken the role of Symmetric Sissa, which was invented by Cetina in the same year: The king goes always three steps in castlings.   Sissa is a chess variant invented in 1998 by Carlos Cetina. The piece called Sissa is taken from another chess variant of Cetina, called Coherent Chess.

Before starting, the players must decide whether they want to use the extra pieces. To make a decision, press on the little black square. Only if both players choose not to use the extra pieces, then it becomes a regular game of chess. If white turns down the extra pieces, then black can overrule this. Right-click on a piece to get more information.","If players have elected to include external pieces, they may either move a piece or pawn, or drop an extra piece from the reserve. Pieces may only be dropped on a friendly pawn on the second rank. The removed friendly pawn must immediately be relocated two squares ahead of the dropped piece. This position, and the position in between, must be empty. If not, the piece cannot be dropped on the friendly pawn. Should a player refrain from inserting his extra pieces at these occasions, then he has forfeited his chance of introducing them. Note that pieces and pawns are allowed to move before an extra piece has been dropped. You are allowed to make a pawn-relocation if in check, if the pawn-relocation covers the check. The relocated pawn can be captured by 'en passant'.","The extra pieces are the following. Chancellor (Princess) : combines the powers of a Rook and a Knight. It is comparable in strength to the queen. Swedish Cannon : after having jumped any piece, the Swedish cannon can slide and capture like a rook. However, if no jump move exists it's allowable to slide like a rook, but without capturing. The Swedish Cannon has about the same value as a bishop. The closest relative of the Swedish Cannon is the Korean Cannon. The Swedish Cannon was invented by undersigned, April 2007. It derives from Swedish Cannon Chess. The Archbishop was known already in the 17th century. D. Pietro Carrera used this piece in his variant Carrera's Chess. He wrote a long book on chess, called 'Il Gioco delgi Scacchi', and published it in 1617 in Miltello in Sicily.","In Stahlberg Chess standard chess is included as an option, thereby maintaining the historical connection. In a tournament, by way of the initial voting procedure, players can decide to play a traditional game.","Introducing the external pieces implies a weakening of the pawn chain, so it's a difficult strategical question whether one should wait, or immediately make use of the drop move to advance a centre pawn two steps. But dropping an extra piece on the king- or queen pawn could block the development of the bishop. Waiting has its obvious advantages, although the alternative positions where the piece can be dropped will become fewer and fewer.","The Swedish Cannon can take active part early in the game, so one ought to introduce it early. The Cannon can be exchanged for a light piece that has acquired a good position, or it can threaten an enemy rook on an half-open file. The Swedish Cannon is stronger than both its counterparts, the Korean Cannon and Chinese Cannon, making it easier to introduce it in a context of Western pieces. Its movement is similar to the Korean Cannon, but the Korean Cannon is stranded when no jump moves are available. This cannot befall the Swedish Cannon while it is then, and only then, allowed to slide like a rook, but without capture. Interestingly, if the enemy Cannon has no jumps, then one can sometimes position a piece so as to provide a jumping option, thus preventing the Cannon from using his right to move like a rook. Stahlberg Chess was invented and implemented by undersigned, May 2007.","Stahlberg Chess was created in remembrance of Swedish grandmaster Gideon Ståhlberg (1908-67), Sweden's first official grandmaster. Ståhlberg became Scandinavian Champion in 1929. His rating for the year 1949 has afterwards been calculated to 2750, and he was the third strongest player in the world in that year. Ståhlberg umpired in the 1963 Botvinnik - Petrosian World Championship match.

Before starting, the players must decide whether they want to use the extra pieces. To make a decision, press on the little black square. Only if both players choose not to use the extra pieces, then it becomes a regular game of chess. If white turns down the extra pieces, then black can overrule this. Right-click on a piece to get more information.","If players have elected to include external pieces, they may either move a piece or pawn, or drop an extra piece from the reserve. Pieces may only be dropped on a friendly pawn on the second rank. The removed friendly pawn must immediately be relocated two squares ahead of the dropped piece. This position, and the position in between, must be empty. If not, the piece cannot be dropped on the friendly pawn. Should a player refrain from inserting his extra pieces at these occasions, then he has forfeited his chance of introducing them. Note that pieces and pawns are allowed to move before an extra piece has been dropped. You are allowed to make a pawn-relocation if in check, if the pawn-relocation covers the check. The relocated pawn can be captured by 'en passant'.","The extra pieces are the following. Archbishop (Cardinal) : combines the powers of a Bishop and a Knight. It is somewhat weaker than a Queen. Culverin: can step in any direction like a king. It can capture only by leaping over any piece. If the nearest piece after the leap is an enemy piece, then it can be captured. Enemy pawns, however, can restrict its movement. The Culverin can only reach the square immediately behind the enemy pawn, regardless of leaping direction. Its value corresponds to a knight or a bishop (my estimate). The Culverin was invented by undersigned, October 2008. See also Culverin Chess for Zillions. The Archbishop was known already in the 17th century. D. Pietro Carrera used this piece in his variant Carrera's Chess. He wrote a long book on chess, called 'Il Gioco delgi Scacchi', and published it in 1617 in Miltello in Sicily.","In Stoltz Chess standard chess is included as an option, thereby maintaining the historical connection. In a tournament, by way of the initial voting procedure, players can decide to play a traditional game.","Introducing the external pieces implies a weakening of the pawn chain, so it's a difficult strategical question whether one should wait, or immediately make use of the drop move to advance a centre pawn two steps. But dropping an extra piece on the king- or queen pawn could block the development of the bishop. Waiting has its obvious advantages, although the alternative positions where the piece can be dropped will become fewer and fewer.","The Culverin can threaten an enemy rook on an half-open file. It is stronger than both its counterparts, the Korean cannon and Chinese cannon, making it easier to introduce it in a context of Western pieces.Note that the pawns constitute a good defence against the Culverin while it can only reach the square immediately behind the enemy pawn. By example, if the black king is checked on the g-file, it can defend itself by moving the pawn forward. While its tactical capacity is truncated the Culverin can harmonize with the positional qualities of the game. Positioned two or more steps behind a friendly pawn, it can threaten an enemy Culverin, which cannot threaten back. This is an important positional aspect. Stoltz Chess was invented and implemented by undersigned, May 2007.","Stoltz Chess was created in remembrance of Swedish grandmaster Gösta Stoltz (born 9 May 1904 - died 25 July 1963). Stoltz won individual gold medal at second board (+10 -1 =7) at the 4th Olympiad in Prague in 1931. He won team bronze medal playing at second board (+5 -3 =6) at the 5th Olympiad in Folkestone in 1933. Stoltz scored a spectacular victory in the Munich, 1941 tournament (München - 2nd Europa-Turnier), 1½ points ahead of Alekhine. Stoltz received the GM title, belatedly, in 1954. His playing style is reminiscent of Michail Tal and Alexander Aljechin, stable positional play interchanged with brilliant combinative sacrifices. The attached game is from the Interzonal tournament 1952 when Stoltz played brilliantly and sacrificed queen against the American Herman Steiner."],"image":"game1415_scr_StoltzChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":4}

The basic idea behind Smess is that arrows on squares determine which directions pieces may move. Storm the Ivory Tower applies this idea to the structure of Chinese Chess. It includes Smess-like equivalents of every piece in Chinese Chess, and it has an Ivory Tower on each side of the board, which is its counterpart to the palace in Chinese Chess. This is a new version of the game. It includes a redesigned board, which now includes a river and a different configuration of arrows, and it redefines powers of movement for three pieces. Overall, the changes make the game less drawish and more analogous to Chinese Chess.","This latest version of the ZRF includes a renamed piece, a recolored Smess-style board, redrawn Smess-style pieces, a bug fix, and in response to user demand, five alternate boards and piece sets. The piece sets are mainly borrowed from my Chinese Chess ZRF. They feature Chinese and western versions of the Chinese Chess pieces. The new boards avoid the child-like appearance of Smess by using uniform arrow designs with simpler or classier color schemes. These should appeal to people who prefer the look of All the King's Men to Smess. Although I am not of that camp and wasn't initially excited about the prospect of adding new boards, I am very pleased with how the alternate boards came out. Thanks go to Michael Howe and Larry Lynn Smith, who both submitted arrow designs that I made use of in making the new boards."],"image":"game869_scr_IvoryTower.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,34],"variations":2}

In the year 1011 A.D., Bishop Arnulf II of Halberstadt was brought a Wendish duke by the name of Guncellin as a prisoner. Guncellin was incarcerated in the Stroebeck watchtower, where he was guarded by local peasants. Boredom tormented not only the noble prisoner, but his guards as well. Guncellin carved 32 chess figures and painted a chess board on the table. Then he taught the guards how to play the game. Chess thrived in the village and was passed down from generation to generation. It was played in families, in the village tavern and in the weaving shops. This was at a time when chess was normally restricted to the royal courts and monasteries. Despite the almost complete destruction of Stroebeck in the Thirty-Years War (1618-1648), the chess tradition has remained alive up to the present day.","In Stroebeck, chess games with living figures (see the screenshot) began in 1688. In Germany, Stroebeck is unique with respect to its school: Since 1823, chess is a compulsory subject in Stroebeck's secondary school. This tradition was never abolished, even not by the Nazis and also not by the communists in the GDR. But nowadays the German state ''Saxonia-Anhalt'' is so short of money that all secondary schools with less then 20 pupils per year shall be closed. And in Stroebeck for the new fifth class - to start in a few weeks after the summer vacation - only 13 pupils are expected. And administration has said that even 19 pupils would not be enough to save class five! So, Stroebeck's \"Chess\" School is in severe danger to die in 2003.","News flash July 26, 2003 (source:  Braunschweiger Zeitung):  The (local) rural districts \"Halberstadt\" (to which Stroebeck belongs) and  \"Wernigerode\" decided that from now on pupils from the nearby villages \"Derenburg\"  und \"Silstedt\" are also allowed to go to school in Stroebeck...  This will lead to more than 20 pupils for the crucial class 5.  Rumor has it that the international Zillions publication of \"Stroebeck Crisis  Chess\" helped leading to this decision.","\"Stroebeck Crisis Chess\" is almost traditional chess. But besides the normal mating and stalemating rules the game ends immediately if the total number of pieces on the board is reduced to 19.

The object for the White side is to move his King (Hnefi) to one of the corner squares, in which case he has successfully escaped. The object for the Black side is to capture the White King. Black makes the first move.","All pieces move like a Rook in chess, that is, any number of squares horizontally or vertically. No pieces, except the King, may land on the corner squares or the centre square. The centre square is the King's throne (Konakis).","Tablut employs orthogonal interception-capture. When an enemy piece is surrounded on two opposite sides, the piece is captured. The corner and centre squares also act like friendly pieces, so if an enemy piece is sandwiched between a friendly piece and these special squares, this also results in capture. Capture is not mandatory. Note that the central square only functions as capture square when it's empty. (In an alternative variant, it needn't be empty to function as capture square.)","The same capture rules applies also to the King, except when it is positioned on the centre square, when it must be surrounded on all four sides. If the King is positioned on any of the four squares adjacent to the centre, it must be surrounded on three sides, plus the centre square, which then functions as a capture-square.","Tablut boards and pieces are often found in Viking graves. Pieces are typically made of bone, glass, or amber. The game had a rich history in Viking tales. In one such story King Knut and Jarl Ulf were playing, and Knut made mistake allowing Ulf to capture a piece. Knut requested that he be allowed to take back his move. Ulf refused, toppling the board, and an argument ensued that ended when Ulf was killed.","The Swedish botanist Carolus Linnæus, the inventor of the system for classifying plants and animals we still use today, wrote about this game in his diary in 1732. He discovered it during his travels in Lapland, where the game had survived and was still played among the Lapps. The side with the King represented the Swedes, while the other side respresented Moscovites.","Watch out whenever a piece is positioned orthogonally adjacent to an opponent's, as it's liable to get captured. Exchanging pieces early in the game would generally benefit White rather than Black, because White needs open space to escape with his King. Black should try to keep the position crowded. Both sides should look out for King moves that allow the King two different paths to the rim, since it will be impossible to block both directions at the same time.","Four variants have been implemented: Tablut (9x9), Brandubh (7x7), Large Hnefatafl (13x13), and Alea Evangeli (19x19). Tablut seems to be a well-balanced game. It's a tough nut to crack, although Black should probably win in the end. In Brandubh White can sometimes achieve a rapid win, but Black's chances seem the best. White could build a fortress, making the king invulnerable, with the intent of repeating moves within the fortress. But this only means that White has lost, while there is no way out and there are only two results: win or lose. If White repeats moves, he loses, too.","Tablut and Large Hnefatafl derive from Scandinavia and are probably more original than Brandubh and Alea Evangelii (The Evangelic Game), which were played on the British islands. Note that the implementation of these games on the Zillions CD (\"Tafl\") uses incorrect rules. In Alea Evangelii the rules are different. If the white King reaches the rim the game is won. The whole periphery functions as capture square.","This implementation follows the rules researched by the Historical Museum, Stockholm, and it shows what a sophisticated game Tablut is. It was immensely popular during the Viking era. It is clearly the king of hunt-games."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[32,12],"variations":7}

{"zrfID":2682,"id":"tavreli","name":"Tavreli","creatorIDs":[505],"creator":"Howard McCay","created":"2018-04-21","description":["Tavreli.  Russian stacking chess.","Tavreli uses multiple grids which require at least version 1.3 of Zillions.","Zillions 1.2 has a bug which causes scripts with multiple grids to miscompile into a single grid with extended position lables.","If you are still running Zillions 1., Zillions version 1.3.1 is available for free from Zillions-of-games.com/patches-131.html.","Because of the complexity of Tavreli stacking rules, this game takes Zillions a long time to load.  Please be patient.","Tavreli is a game very like European Chess played long ago in Russia.  Tavreli has recently revived in popularity in Russia.  The object is the same: checkmate the King, who is called Magus in Tavreli.  In this implementation, standard English names are used for the other pieces.  The starting lineup is identical.  The moves and capture rules are the same, including castling, en-passant capture, and promotion upon arrival on the opponent's back row.","How does traditional Tavreli differ from standard European Chess?","The most notable difference from standard European Chess is that Tavreli pieces are flat discs that stack.  Tavreli pieces are distinguished, not by their shapes, but by icons that show the directions of their moves.  Pieces are never removed from the game of Tavreli.  Instead, your piece just lands on top of them.  On any later move you may move the entire stack according to the move or capture powers of the top piece.  Or you may split the stack at any point, leaving the bottom piece(s) where they were.  Whichever piece you leave on top of the abandoned portion of the stack you split will control the future movement of any piece(s) left below.  The exposed piece will have lost any promotional powers they may have acquired.  In traditional Tavreli, you would rarely want to split one of your controlled stacks, leaving on top any piece that was not yours originally.","Another important difference is that you may move on top of your own pieces.  Although this move is like capturing your own piece(s) in that the covered piece(s) will lose any promotional powers, moving on top of your own piece(s) is a move, not a capture: your Pawn may not use its diagonal capture to step on top of your own piece(s), only its normal forward one or two space move.  The Magus may step on top of any stack, but no friendly piece may step on top of the Magus.","Promotion occurs when appearing alone or on top of a stack by move or by capture or by being left alone or on top of a split stack on the opponent's back row.  Promotion is not a choice in Tavreli.  Traditional Tavreli pieces are all marked on their edges as well as on their faces with the symbol for their kind of piece, so that players can identify the components of a stack without touching them.  Each traditional Tavreli Pawn is also marked on its edges and on its flip side with the insignia of whichever piece that that Pawn starts in front of.  No matter where he may end up on top in the opponent's back row, that Pawn will promote to the piece whose mark he bears.  The Pawn who begins in front of the Magus does not become a second Magus.  The Magus' Pawn will become a Helgi.  The Helgi can do anything that a Bishop, Horse, or Rook can do.","How does this Tavreli differ from traditional Tavreli?","Every piece that you land on top of will become yours.  So on any later move you can split any of your stacks at any point and both stacks will remain yours.","Every piece in this game can move forward like a Pawn, one or two spaces straight forward from any position on the board where they may have reached or been left on top of a split stack, at any point in the game.  The space moved onto must be empty or have one of your own on top.  When you move two spaces, the intermediate space must be entirely empty and, if the piece moving two spaces does not have the Rook's move (Rook, Queen, Marshall, or Helgi), the piece moving two spaces and those pieces he dragged with him may be captured en passant by any opposing piece (not just by a Pawn) on the opponent's very next turn, as if the moving piece and stack were to have moved only one space.","The Magus (and his promoted form the Nugus) can castle with one of his Rooks or any of his pieces having a Rook's move (Rook, Queen, Marshall, or Helgi) any number of times during the game (even across check and even to get out of check) whenever one of his rook-movers sits on the same horizontal rank with their Magus, at least two open spaces away, and with no other pieces in between.  The Magus slides two spaces toward the rook-mover.  The rook-mover piece leaps over to the other side of the Magus, landing on the empty space that the Magus just slid over.  If your Magus is sitting on a stack when you begin castling, you may choose how many underlings to carry with the Magus, leaving behind the bottom portion, just as for any other move.  If your rook-mover is sitting on a stack when castling, the rook-mover will carry all of their underlings with them, leaving no one behind.","The traditional Tavreli restriction that no friendly piece can cover the Magus does not apply to this Tavreli.  While covered, the Magus is unable to perform his normal moves, including castling.  If your Magus' stack is captured by the enemy, you lose, the same as when your Magus is on top or alone.","Every piece in this game can promote.  Promotion occurs when a piece appears alone or on top of a stack by move or by capture or by being left on top of a split stack on the opponent's back row.  Promotion is according to where the piece lands or is left, not according to where it began.  Unless the piece should already possess the powers of the piece that starts on the space where it lands, every piece, except the Magus, will acquire that space's starting piece's power, keeping all its prior abilities except diagonal capture when a Pawn is promoted to Horse or Rook.  When arriving or being left on top of the opposing Magus' starting space, every piece, except the Magus, becomes a Helgi.  A Pawn will become a Rook, Horse, Bishop, Queen, or Helgi, according to where he lands.  Horses and Queens become Helgis on each other's spaces or on the Magus' starting space.  Bishops and Rooks become Queens on each other's spaces or on the Queen'a starting space.  Rooks and Horses will become Marshalls on each other's starting spaces.  Horses and Bishops will become Cardinals on each other's starting spaces.  The Magus becomes a Nugus on any space of the opponent's back row, adding the power of the Horse to his movement and castling powers.  All promotions are temporary.  As in traditional Tavreli, promoted pieces will lose all their promotions when captured or landed on by their own pieces.","For details on how to play, please read also the strategy help inside the game.","How did they invent Tavreli?","Tavreli may have developed from the use of flat pieces with markings on their faces, similar to and perhaps infuenced by the Chinese or Korean chess pieces.  These flat pieces would have been easier to manufacture than the more elaborately carved pieces used in Africa, India, the Middle East, and Europe.  Marking pieces with their movement diagrams may have easier for Russian or possibly Scandinavian people to learn than the Chinese characters used on both the Chinese and Korean pieces would have been.  Marking the reverse sides of the flat pieces with their promoted values could have been influenced by Japanese chess which also uses flat pieces with fixed promotions.","Stacking the pieces is most probably a native Russian innovation.  Marking the edges of the pieces with their icons would have then become a requirement so players would not need to remember what was in the stack.  The requirement for promotion on a round piece limits the possibility of acquiring or recruiting captured pieces, unlike the pointed Japanese pieces which can show both their promotional and their team status.","The current double move for the Pawn, en passant capture, and castling rules were probably added to Tavreli more recently as they were added to western European Chess.","Recruiting of captured enemy pieces, the double move for Pawns from any position, pawn-move for other pieces, en-passant capture by pieces other than the Pawn, promotions according to position of arrival, promotions for pieces other than the Pawn, castling across check, castling to escape check, castling with rook-movers other than Rooks, castling more than once, are all new to this version of Tavreli.","Because of the difficulty of tracking and showing stacking pieces in a strictly two-dimensional implementation like Zillions of Games, this is probably the first computerized implementation of Tavreli.","This Zillions implementation is dedicated to Valentin Chelnokof of Kazan.

Below is a game I played of it with Zillions which has most everything                 shown, terrain-wise.                                 The terrain types are as follows:                                 Nothing - A normal square, before anything has landed on                 it. It does nothing.                Grass - Grass, a harmless terrain type left behind by pawns,                 and sometimes the King.                Mud - A thick brown ooze of dirt and water, left behind by                 Knights.                Water - A large puddle, left behind by Bishops.                Ice - A small patch of ice, left behind by the Queen.                Void - The absence of all matter, left behind by the Rook.                                                The above types of terrain are left behind on the square that the                 corresponding piece has just vacated. The terrain types have these                 effects on pieces:                Grass - None                Mud - Any sliding piece (Queen, Bishop, Rook) stops their                 slide at a patch of mud.                Water - Only the Rook and Knight can land on a patch of water.                 The Knight, however, cannot leap _over_ water.                Ice - Only the Queen and Bishop may land on ice.                Void - Only the King may land on the Void, but the Rook may                 slide past it.                                                The only exception to these rules is the King - if the King is on                 a normal unterrained square, it leaves behind Grass, otherwise it                 leaves whatever is already there.

All                 the standard chess pieces in Terror Chess move in the same way they                 do in normal chess. The additional pieces of the Cardinal, Marshall,                 and Terror are all well known chess variant pieces. I have graphically                 depicted the Terror in consistent manner as the Marshall and Cardinal,                 which makes Terror Chess very easy to learn and play for anyone                 who already knows standard chess.                 The                 idea behind Terror Chess came to me after playing some other large                 chess variants which used the Marshall and Cardinal with the standard                 chess set. Games like Capablanca's Large Chess thus have pieces                 representing all dual combinations of the three basic piece movement                 types: bishop movement, knight movement, and rook movement. Terror                 Chess adds in the Terror, which combines all three movement types.                                 Please                 send me any bug reports or thoughts about the game.

Instead the Trebuchet, when it moves, has the power to sling a piece located behind itself to a forward square in the alignment direction. The slung piece, which can be of any colour, is the nearest piece in the opposite direction of the move. This piece is hurled to the square immediately forward of the square on which the Trebuchet stops. Any enemy piece positioned here is captured. Thus the Trebuchet can be used for transporting friendly pieces, attacking enemy pieces, or removing enemy pieces from good positions. In opening and middlegame the Trebuchet introduces new tactical themes. If it remains on the first rank it can transport the rooks and the king very effectively along the first rank. In the endgame it can transport friendly pawns and the friendly king over the board. It can open files for the rooks, by removing a friendly pawn sideways. Pawns can be catapulted to their promotion square, when they are promoted to queen as only alternative. Pawns cannot be catapulted to the first rank, that is, the second rank is the limit. Kings and rooks retain their castle rights if catapulted away and back, while they haven't moved by their own accord. Other rules are the same as in standard chess, except for the possible promotion to Trebuchet. The Trebuchet's value is the same as a bishop (preliminary estimate).

Each player has a force of 48 pieces.   ARCHBISHOP[A] slides diagonal or triagonal. BISHOP[B] slides diagonal. DRAGON[D] slides orthogonal or triagonal. FAVOURITE[F] slides orthogonal or diagonal. GARGOYLE[G] steps one or leaps to the next orthgonal, diagonal or triagonal cell. HIPPOGRIFF[H] leaps to the opposite corner of a 2x2x3 area. KING[K] steps one orthogonal, diagonal or triagonal cell. KNIGHT[N] leaps to the opposite corner of a 1x2x3 area. PAWN[P] steps without capturing one forward orthogonal cell, captures to any one          forward diagonal or triagonal cell and promotes, upon reaching the farthest          rank, to any previously captured piece.  In Tri-Ashtapada Chess, the Pawn          is allowed to make an initial two step move, as long as both cells are vacant.

The board is covered with triangular cells in four colour networks. The four colours help to define the paths of bishops since each bishop moves through cells of one colour in a zigzag along a line which is parallel to a side of the board. Each player starts with a bishop in each of the four coloured networks, otherwise each player has a standard set of chess pieces but placed initially around a corner or the centre of a side of the board. Piece moves resemble those of the corresponding pieces in standard chess being one or more steps which are each either orthogonal, across a common side, or diagonal, across a common vertex, in a straight line between two cells.","Concepts which do not transfer from standard chess to TriBoChess are: initial double step movement of a pawn; en passant pawn moves; pawn promotion; castling.

People of that times felt the necessity to introduce King  and Queen to fit the spirit of that age.  What they did, was to create nowadays chess as we know it.","In another variant I was considering, I tried to reproduce Xianqi  as it was, a War game, with a General (King), two powerful warrior  at his side (Queens) and so on.","There is another possibility, I think also reasonable and logical,  to introduce the King and Queen as our ancestors wanted.  The only way to do that without removing one of the powerful warriors  - and then create the nowadays 8x8 chess game - is to leave all the  war pieces as they are, and to substitute the single piece general  with the two pieces King and a Queen. In this way the board gets  10x10 and everything is symmetric.","For reason of space, the pawns must obviously move more forward,  that's why I introduced a 3rd steps forward.","Due to the lot of space the strategy in this variation should be  really great, this game should be very open and complex. The player  has all the space and pieces to use his creativity.","The Soldiers are introduced, like two modern chess Queens in a 10x10  checkerboard.","Every piece can move one step in every direction (!) I introduced  this rule as it is. It is necessary to increase the general power  of the pieces. A mere Knight or Bishop in a 10x10 board is easily  taken by the opponent team. Things are different if they can move  one step in any direction.","This gives a lot of flexibility to pieces movement and equilibrate  the super attack power of two Soldier on the board.  Just imagine to have a Bishop on a diagonal, and just shift it on  another one... a great new potential in gameplay.","The Queen moves only in any direction like her King.

Only knight pawns on the fifth rank have this capability. The pawn loses this capability when it advances to the 6th rank. Compared with standard chess, this means that an advanced knight pawn is endowed with an extra jump move. Valiant Chess is specially designed for rapidchess, since it makes the game more aggressive and less monotonous. Aggressive play on the flanks is facilitated as the Valiant pawn makes it possible to pry open the pawn chain, something which greatly enhances attacking play. In this way one can open the file in order to attack the king, or disrupt the position for attacking purposes. This new rule favours the advance of the knight pawn, which leads to a more aggressive game.","In an alternative variant both the knight- and rook pawn, having advanced to the fifth rank, can make this knight jump to empty square. This could lead to wild play. The most conservative variant is to allow the jump only when the pawn is blocked.","In the general case, it is easy to control these extra destination squares, or to occupy them, thus preventing the pawn from going there. In many cases it is simply bad to go there. However, it opens up many new attacking possibilities. This pawn move isn't illogical. It moves forward one rank, which is natural to the pawn. Keep in mind that the pawn is already different from all other pieces in that it can only advance to an empty square, different from the capture square. In this variant, yet another pawn advance to empty square is added, provided that the pawn is positioned at the knight file and the fifth rank. It is a natural move that already belongs in chess in the form of the knight jump. Interestingly, there is a corresponding rule in Xiangqi (Chinese Chess). When the pawn passes the middle line it acquires the capacity to move sideways. See also Dynamic Chess.

White first removes a light piece and then black removes one of his light pieces and places it behind the board. These pieces can at any time be introduced via any empty square on the first rank and move immediately, effectively a double-move. They can be introduced at any time, provided that a move exists that originates from the first rank. For instance, if the white queen has already moved away, a knight can be introduced via d1, thus reaching the square b2 (provided that it is empty). A bishop cannot be inserted on the same colour squares as the other bishop. Variable Chess is intended as an alternative to standard chess, radically increasing the ramification of openings. By waiting a few moves before introducing an external piece, a player can hide his strategical intentions. In an alternative variant, two light pieces per player are placed outside the board.

(It can be called both, because the game is called Vortex                 Chess, but the piece-name I put in for the vortex itself was \"Portal\",                 and I didn't notice it at the time due to my caffeinated state.                 :P)                                 The setup is as below, with white's vortex (the blue one) on the                 fourth rank on the far left, and black's (the red one) on the fifth                 to the far right.                                 The effect of the vortex is as follows: Any piece that would otherwise                 land on the space occupied by the vortex, its path is transplanted                 onto the space in that same direction from the other vortex.                                 For example, from the opening move, the leftmost pawn of White can                 move to the sixth rank on the far right, because it has an opening                 move of two.                                 The movement of the vortex piece is simple - it can move to any                 unoccupied square. At first I thought this might make it too easy                 to defend a King in check, but upon seeing Zillions' response to                 this tactic, I realized that the portal can only defend the King                 if there is only one space between the King and the attacker, as                 the opponent can always place their portal next to yours, in effect                 nullifying it.                                 Knights take a little getting used to in Vortex Chess, depending                 on how you remember how they move. A Knight can leap over a portal,                 but if it lands on one, it moves diagonally from the other, not                 orthogonally, which is what a person might think if they use the                 L-shape movement for ease of remembering. :)                                 This ZRF has two variations - the default allowing movement of the                 portals only once every other turn, by alternating sides.

This magic piece can change movement capability by using up a move to transform itself. A Warlock rook can change into a Warlock cannon by turning the rook upside down, or vice versa. The Warlock cannon uses Korean Cannon movement: it moves as a rook after having jumped a piece. If it cannot jump then it cannot move. As such, it is somewhat weaker than a knight, but its tactical capacity is great. In any case, the Warlock cannon can always transform itself back into a Warlock rook. After the piece is transformed it must make a move before making yet another transformation. So it's not possible to stay put and make continual transformations on the same square.    The Warlock has great attacking potential, and it's much easier to maneuvre than the clumsy rook. It is more valuable than a rook, but it costs time to transform back and forth between its cannon and rook guises. Warlock means sorcerer, witch, or conjurer. The primary piece graphics was created by P. Wong, Australia.    There is also a variant with an \"improved pawn\", which has an additional movement direction. The improved Pawn, provided that it (1) has reached the fifth rank, and (2) the forward movement is blocked, has the additional moves of a knight, but only in two forward directions: east-north-east, and west-north-west, and only to empty squares. There are no additional capture moves. Middlegame and endgame are more aggressive while improved Pawns are not easy to block.

It is played on a 9x9 weave pattern set against a black background. The white spaces as a group are called the Weave. The black spaces are called the Dungeon. The Weave and the Dungeon constitute separate playing fields that interact with one another. Motion on the Weave is twisting and non-Euclidian. Motion in the Dungeon is traditional and linear.","The Weave consists of five vertical strands interwoven with five horizontal strands. Each strand is broken into two or three segments by cross-strands. The segments in turn consist of two or three spaces. A space located at the intersection of two strands is called a bridge. A space laterally adjacent to a Dungeon space is called a slope. The strands can be thought of as sine curves viewed from above. Bridges are located at the crests of each curve, and slopes connect bridges to the (hidden) troughs of the curve. An adjacent bridge and slope are continuous if located in the same strand. They are normal, i.e., perpendicular, if located in different strands. The Dungeon consists of sixteen black spaces called cells. Cells are considered adjacent if separated by a single Weave space.","There are two types of motion: sliding and stepping. Sliding consists of continuous motion along a smooth surface. Pieces slide when moving within the Dungeon or along a strand. A step occurs when a piece abruptly changes altitude by moving across an edge. Pieces step when moving between a normal bridge and slope, or between the Weave and the Dungeon.","A single move can combine sliding and stepping. An important example is \"stepping down from one segment to another,\" or \"segment stepping.\" This occurs when a piece, starting from any space in a segment, slides to the bridge of the segment (if not already there), steps down to a normal slope, and comes to rest on any space in the new segment. A piece that steps down from one segment to another must always step as part of the move. It cannot start and stop within the same segment.","All pieces capture by replacement. With the exception of the Circle, a piece cannot move across an occupied space. Pieces can, however, move underneath other pieces when taking an underpass or an implied cell.","To see how each individual piece moves, open the ReadMe file that comes with the game or right click on the piece.","Win by checkmating the opponent Star. Stalemate and repetition are a loss.","The bridge on which the Star begins the game is called its throne. A Star that steps off its throne is said to abdicate. It is imprisoned when it enters the Dungeon. In a typical game one or both Stars are forced into the Dungeon, from which they are helpless from checks delivered from the overhanging Weave. The Stars are quite mobile, however, and are often chased throughout the Dungeon before checkmate can be achieved.","Although a win is a win, Weave \u0026 Dungeon grades wins according to quality. A player that wins with his Star unmoved on its throne earns a Triumph, the highest level. A player that wins with his Star on the Weave earns an Ovation. If both Stars are in the Dungeon, the winning player earns a simple Victory.","Please send any comments or bug reports to dtroyka@justice.com."],"image":"game944_scr_Weave.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

It occurred to me that a chess-like game could be played on a board resembling that window; hence the idea for WINDOWS CHESS took root.","The board consists of forty-eight square cells and sixteen trapeze cells arranged in four concentric loops of sixteen cells each.  Another way to think of it is as a traditional board with eight ranks and eight files, with the files joined at each end - [a] and [h], [b] and [g], [c] and [f], and [d] and [e].  The joined files - the trapeze cells - are called the \"polar\" regions.  The game thus has much in common both with traditional FIDE chess and with the family of variants played on round or cylindrical boards.","At setup, the pieces occupy their traditional home cells and generally retain the movement properties familiar to players of FIDE Chess, albeit with some exceptions explained below.  There is one additional piece, the Conqueror, a Queen-Knight compound corresponding to the Amazon in some other varieties of Chess or to the Maharajah in MAHARAJAH AND THE SEPOYS.  The Conqueror is purely a promotion piece; on reaching the eighth rank, a Pawn is crowned as a Conqueror.","The sixteen \"polar\" cells (the trapezes) have a peculiar effect on the movements of the Knight and Bishop, and of the Queen and Conqueror.  I got this idea from the behaviour of a compass at the North and South Poles: it goes wild.  Every direction from the \"pinhead\" of the North Pole is SOUTH, so one's sense of direction gets distorted.  This gave me the idea of using the \"polar\" regions of the board to \"bend\" the paths of the Bishop and Knight.  Each polar trapeze acts like a pivot which swivels the Bishop's path, and the corner trapezes (d1, e1, d8, and e8) even allow the Bishop to migrate from cells of one colour to the other.  The Bishop is therefore no longer colourbound, and can occupy all 64 cells on the board.  The \"polar\" cells also bend the Knight's L-shaped path back upon itself, so that a Knight in the polar regions can sometimes move to or from an adjacent cell.  This works when moving to or from cells c1, d1, e1, f1, d2, or e2 on White's side, or c8, d8, e8, f8, d7, or e7 on Black's side.","I have decided to do away with Castling and En Passant captures.  I never liked the En Passant rule, while castling serves to protect the King and bring a Rook into play.  On a round board, the former is not so effective and the latter is superfluous, in my opinion.  I am willing to reconsider this in future releases if popular demand and/or playtesting with Zillions indicates it to be a desirable feature, however.","WINNING CONDITIONS","Win by checkmating the enemy King.  Stalemate and baring the King count as a qualified win - better than a draw but not as good as a checkmate.  Award a point for a checkmate or a royal conversion, a half-point for forcing a stalemate or baring the enemy King, and a half-point to both players in the event of a draw.","STILL CONFUSED?","Look in the DIAGRAMS folder (GIF format) for illustrations and detailed explanations about each piece's properties."],"image":"game2187_scr_WindowsChess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

The initial setup can be seen in the diagram below.","The board shown below is designed to aid the visualization of diagonal moves, while still retaining the characteristics that distinguish a Chinese Chess board from a checkered western board.  As in Chinese Chess, pieces occupy intersections rather than spaces.  Sages and Arrows can move along visible diagonal lines or along roads between two parallel diagonal lines.  It is painted to resembles the Chinese Chess board, though the river and fortress play no special role in the game.  It comes with three sets of pieces.  The set shown below is based on Big5 Chinese characters.  Another set is based on simplified GB Chinese characters, and a third set (for those who get confused by Chinese characters) is based on my abstract piece set.

Updated May 10, 2003: several mods by L. Lynn Smith. Rabbit Elimination and Immobilization wins added by Tim O'Lena, June 2020. Translated into 3D by Tim O'Lena, June 2020.","See the 'Learn to Play' section on www.arimaa.com for an animated tutorial.","Objective There are three ways to win a game of Arimaa. The first player to get just one Rabbit across the board to a goal cell wins. On this 3D board, Gold's goals are 5a5-5e5; Silver's goals are 1a1-1e1.  Another way to win is to eliminate all of the opponent's Rabbits. In standard Arimaa, you win if you capture the opponent's last Rabbit, even if you sacrifice your own last Rabbit to do so. The third way to win is by immobilizing your opponent. Stalemate is a LOSS for the immobilized side.","Setup The game has no fixed starting position for the pieces.  The game starts","with an empty board.  First Gold sets down all the Gold pieces in any order on the four rows closes to Gold, on the bottom of the board. Silver then sets down all the Silver pieces on the four rows closest to Silvers side, on the top of the board.  Once the pieces have been set down the players take turns moving the pieces with Gold going first. Each player has 10 Rabbits, 3 Cats, 3 Dogs, 2 Horses, 1 Camel and 1 Elephant.","Steps On each turn the players can take up to 4 steps. All pieces move the same way, which","is laterally like a Rook in Hexagonal Chess. Except that Rabbits cannot move","backwards. So all pieces have up to six degrees of freedom, depending upon which space they occupy,  except Rabbits, which have only four degrees of freedom. (A Gold Rabbit may move Up, but not Down; North, but not South.) Moving a piece from its current space to an adjacent space counts as one step.  The 4 steps can be distributed across multiple pieces.  Thus a player can move one piece 4 steps, four pieces 1 step each, one piece 3 steps and another piece 1 step,  etc. The same piece may take steps in different directions. A player must change the configuration of the board on every turn - it is illegal to cancel your own moves out, resulting in no change to the position. The position must be different at the end of a players turn. You may pass up to three of your four moves if you like.","Pushing and Pulling A piece can push opponents weaker pieces to any adjacent space and","move into its place. This is called 'pushing' and uses up 2 steps; one for","pushing the opponents piece and one for moving into its space. Pushing must","be completed within a players turn and cannot be distributed across turns.  The Elephant is the strongest and can push any other piece except another Elephant. The Elephant is followed in strength by the Camel, then the Horse, Dog, Cat and","finally the Rabbit which is the weakest and cannot push any other piece.  Pieces","of equal strength cannot push each other. A piece can also pull opponents weaker pieces which are adjacent","into the space that it moved from.  This is called 'pulling' and uses up","2 steps; one for moving the piece and one for pulling the opponents piece. A piece cannot simultaneously push and pull. You may push or pull only one opposing piece at a time. But it is possible -and legal- to push and/or pull twice in the same turn, using the four available steps.","Example: Gold's Elephant on 1b1 moves to 1c1, pulling a Silver cat from 1a1 to 1b1. That uses two steps. In the next two steps, Gold moves the Elephant from 1c1 to 1c2, pushing a Rabbit from 1c2 to 1c3. In this example, Gold could also have chosen to pull the Cat twice, with the Cat ending on 1c1.","Freezing A piece that is alone and adjacent to an opponents stronger piece is","considered 'frozen' and cannot move. A piece is considered to be alone if","there are no friendly pieces adjacent to it. The lonely weaker piece","can be 'unfrozen' by moving any other friendly piece next to it. When no longer","alone the weaker piece is unfrozen and can immediately begin to move within","the same turn.","Traps The positions at 2b3, 2d3, 4b3 and 4d3 are called 'traps'.

Promotes to either BISHOP, KNIGHT, ROOK or QUEEN on any far rank.  A PAWN located on one of its starting rank is permitted an initial two-step non-capturing move.  En passant rules apply.","KNIGHT[N] leaps to the opposite corner of a 1x1x2, 1x1x3 1x2x2, 1x2x3 or 1x3x3 area.","BISHOP[B] slides or hook-moves diagonal.","ROOK[R] slides or hook-moves orthogonal.","QUEEN[Q] slides or hook-moves orthogonal or diagonal.","KING[K] steps orthogonal or diagonal.","The game is won by checkmating the opposing KING.","Several pieces in this game use a particular form of movement called hook-move.  The hook-move can be found in some large Shogi variants.","This move is basically a translation by the piece along one vacant path then turning perpendicular.  So that a ROOK might slide forward along a file then either turn right, left, up or down.  It is not allowed to perform the hook-move from an occupied cell.","The hook-move in this game is bound to specific planes, those being the 8x8 planes of the levels, the 3x8 planes of the ranks and the 3x8 planes of the files.  Thus a BISHOP with its diagonal hook-move would not be allowed to leave the plane which it began this movement.  So that if the BISHOP started sliding toward the far right corner of the 8x8 plane of a level, it would not be permitted to make a diagonal move which resulted in it exiting that level. With the previous stated starting direction, the only diagonal hook-move it would be permitted would be to the near right corner or the far left of that particular level.","The reasoning behind the use of the hook-move in 3D Chess is to allow for few pieces to achieve the mate of an opposing KING.  This also allows the Rook to retain its power which it exercises in 2D by being able to completely dominate a plane and thus block the advancement of an opposing KING."],"image":"game1120_scr_3D_Hook-Move_Chess.gif","category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12],"variations":0}

At least until the end of the 19th century, a variant of 4-handed Chaturanga was played in several parts of India. In medieval times, the game was mostly played with dice (four-sided long dice), often with stakes involved.","The four players form two teams of two players. Red plays together with yellow, and green plays together with black. The king, rook, and knight move as in orthodox chess. Pawns, too, move as in orthodox chess, but have no initial double move. The boat jumps two squares diagonally.","The first team that has taken both opponents' kings wins the game. The medieval long dice determine which piece can be moved. To throw the dice, click on the left die. One can make two moves in a row, or choose to pass one or both moves. To pass a move one must press the yellow marking on the right side of the board. A tone is then heard. The long die has four sides, showing 2, 3, 4, and 5. Its values are as follows: 2 = boat, 3 = knight, 4 = rook, 5 = king or pawn. You must pass manually if you don't own the piece anymore.","A player can not move his pieces after his own king is captured (the program will pass his moves automatically). However, should the partner capture an enemy king, then the immobilized party can re-introduce a king, and become mobile again. When this happens, a king appears to the right of the board. The immobilized player can introduce this king on an empty square anywhere on the board. In this case he has no second move, so he must pass the second move. Note that a king that has been captured twice cannot be introduced again.","Pawns promote to any of the four types: rook, knight, boat, or king. Piece-type is determined by the promotion square. For Yellow, the a-, and h-files are boat-files, as the boats' initial squares are on these files. Hence, Yellow promotes to boats on a8 and h8, knights on b8 and g8, rooks on c8 and f8, and kings on d8 and f8.","It is possible to capture one's partners pieces. However, in this implementation, capture of the partner's king is prohibited (that would be unethical!).

{"zrfID":858,"id":"6d-chess","name":"6D Chess","creatorIDs":[6],"creator":"W. D. Troyka","created":"2001-11-17","description":["6D Chess is the final installment in the nD Chess series, which began with 3D Chess, 4D Chess, and 5D Chess. These games take chess from the regular 2D environment to boards of successively higher dimensions. This is accomplished, in essence, by adding one orthogonal axis per dimension.  The rules of standard chess apply, subject to the following:","6D Chess is played on a 2x2x2x2x2x2 board. Each of the eight 2x2x2 cubic sub-boards is connected to its three neighbors (4-east or 4-west, 5-up or 5-down, 6-east or 6-west) such that each space in a sub-board is orthogonally adjacent to its counterparts in the neighboring boards. These three connections, along with the three within any 2x2x2 cube, give each space six orthogonally adjacent neighbors. The board is perfectly symmetric along all six axes.","Diagonal motion of the Queen and Bishop takes place in any plane defined by two of the board's six axes (i.e., they do not move \"triagonally,\" \"quadragonally,\" etc.). In other words, a diagonal step consists of two orthogonal steps, each along a different axis.","The King moves only orthogonally.","The Knight has a non-capturing and a capturing move. When not capturing, it moves one step triagonally (i.e., to a space three orthogonal steps away, with each step along a different axis). When capturing, it moves one step orthogonally.","Pawns move one orthogonal step in the direction of the opponent's King row (up, 4-east, 5-up, or 6-west for White), capture as they move (i.e., no diagonal captures), and promote on the opponent's King row.","No castling, en passant, or two-step Pawn moves, and stalemate is a loss. In the variant, Pawns can capture enemy Pawns along any diagonal. This rule allows for Pawn interaction which does not exist in the principal game because the Pawns are on inverted rows.  The nD Chess series attempts to preserve as much from standard chess as is possible through the translation to higher dimensions. The boards in each variant contain 64 squares, starting with 4x4x4 in the 3D version, and progressing to 4x4x2x2, 4x2x2x2x2, and 2x2x2x2x2 in the 6D variant. Each game begins with the regular complement of 32 pieces which retain, as far as practicable, their move definitions. The Rook in all four games slides along an orthogonal and the Bishop along a diagonal. The Queen combines the powers of the Rook and Bishop. The Knight in the 3D, 4D, and 5D versions moves in the familiar fashion by taking two steps in a line followed by a perpendicular step.  The principal differences from regular chess motion lay in the King, Pawns, and 6D Knight. The King is confined to orthogonal motion in the 5D and 6D versions (and in the variants of the 3D and 4D games) because otherwise its mobility leads to frequent draws. The Pawns in each game move one orthogonal step in the direction of the opponent's King row and promote upon reaching that row, a natural definition which was adopted in Raumschach. In the 3D and 4D versions they capture, as might be expected, to either side of a square to which they could move. In the 5D and 6D games they capture as they move; otherwise they are too powerful. The 6D Knight has a unique definition because the regular Knight's move is impossible (there are no dimensions of the required three units in length). Finally, castling, en passant, and the Pawn double step, which serve no purpose in these games, have been eliminated.  Believe it or not, this is not the first attempt at a 6D version of chess. For a description of previous efforts, check out the History section that comes with the game.  For another 4D chess variant, try Chesseract. For other hypergames, there's Hyperspace, Skava, Superstring, Wormhole, and Tessa."],"category":"checkmate","themes":[1,12,28],"variations":2}

'Aperiodic Tilings' uses more or less the same functions (apart from the copy functions). Hence only the copy functions will be explained here again.","It is very easy to create aperiodic (i.e. non-repetitive) tilings from self-similar polygons. This is the method we use here and this is also the method which the famous 'Pinwheel Tiling' uses; see history text for details. The method creates patterns which are on the line between order and chaos. This makes them visually pleasing.","As you can see on the board, we start off with a simple shape, in this case a domino, which can be tiled by smaller copies of itself. These smaller copies have all the same size in this case, but this is not necessary in general.","The second drawing shows a domino twice the size of the first, and tiled with 4 smaller copies of the first. The third drawing shows a domino twice the size of the second, and tiled with 4 copies of the second.If we produce bigger and bigger dominoes this way, we will cover bigger and bigger areas. The resulting covering of the plane will be indeed aperiodic. We make this more visible by colouring the second domino with 4 different colours and keeping these colours when we make copies of diagram 2.","Your task is to try to repeat the suggested process until the given 50x50 board is fully covered.The four templates shown at the right border help you with this. Using them you can draw a 2x4 template made from four dominoes with each click.The HOTSPOT option allows you to change the location of the handle on the template. For some variants the hotspot is fixed.","The solution (select Help/ShowSolution) will show you what your result should look like.Depending on into which direction you enlarge the domino with each step, the outcome will look slightly different. When you have covered a large area this way, click 'delete all outlines', then click 'add all outlines' to create some interesting patterns.It also pays sometimes to make 2 or 3 colours the same first (use button 'exchange colours').","Variants: In some variants (such as variant 3) one has to alternate between two dissection methods with each 'generation' of enlargement in order to obtain a aperiodic pattern.","There is also a FREEPLAY variant with an empty board.","The most famous aperiodic tilings of the plane are most probably :","the 'Pinwheel Tiling' attributed to Charles Radin, featured on the Melbourne Federation Square Buildings (http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/texture/pinwheel/). The pinwheel tiling is of the self-similar type discussed in this game. It is derived from a right triangle with sides 1 and 2 tiled by five smaller copies of itself.","Roger Penrose's quasi-crystals with near-fivefold symmetry. If all the smaller copies have same size, the polygon is called a 'reptile' (from repetition tiling). If the smaller copies have different sizes, the polygon is called an 'irreptile'. Each reptile is also an irreptile. Irreptiles which are not reptiles are called 'puritiles'. The terms 'irreptile' and 'puritile' were introduced in my book 'A Puzzling Journey To The Reptiles And Related Animals' (available from http://karl.kiwi.gen.nz/), which researches deeply in these topics."],"image":"game1080_scr_Aperiodic_Tilings.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[9,11],"variations":6}

The longest known tours have been found by hand, so you might be able to improve on them.   40 fixed setups: Variant  1 to 10: 16 destinations on 10x10 board. Variant 11 to 20: 25 destinations on 10x10 board. Variant 21 to 30: 25 destinations on 13x15 board. Variant 31 to 40: 36 destinations on 13x15 board.   There are also four randomized variants:  - 16 destinations on 10x10 board.  - 25 destinations on 10x10 board.  - 25 destinations on 13x15 board.  - 36 destinations on 13x15 board.   Experts may also try to find the best solutions for the cases where a path can only cross itself at right angles! For which variants does the result differ from the standard best solution? What if no crossings are allowed at all?   Note that there are several alternative piece sets which you might find easier to look at.      Related Zillions games: African Tour, Twisted Tour.   Technical information: In African Tour and Twisted Tour I had to compare 'numbers' and decide which is smaller or larger than the other. For small numnbers this can be easily sone with simple 'if then else'. For large numbers as in this game Asian Tour I came up with a much better technique, namely using 'binary piece attributes'. E.g., the image nr17 of the number 17 carries the piece attributes b16? true and b1? true. This allows to determine larger/smaller with just a few ifs, even for very large numbers (see macro Check-larger).

It is a system and language designed for game creation.  Specifically, Axiom games consist of a Zillions plug-in DLL and one or more scripts written in the Axiom language. Creating a new game involves producing an Axiom script that describes the game logic.  Similar to the way in which the \"zrf\" language is based on the Lisp language, the Axiom language is based on the Forth language.","Axiom supports the ability for game developers to specify the Game AI and therefore it can be applied to, and excels at, non chess-like games such as territorial and connection games. In addition, the full power of the Forth language is available to Axiom game developers.  This includes such things as the ability to use variables, perform math, define functions and data, etc.  While most of the basics of game definition are similiar to that of Zillions, a working knowledge of the Forth programming language and some willingness to \"program\" is required in order to make effective use of Axiom.","The \"Axiom Development Kit\" provided here is intended to be a self-contained distribution of the Axiom system.

It is important to understand that without further interference this random player would play the same sequence of cards every time you start the game,  which is not very useful in our case. For this reason we have to use the Axiom command SET-SEED to 're-seed' the  random sequence before each card-show by the random player.

You will be shown a playing area that the computer will try to fill.  To start, click the playing area. Zillions will AUTOMATICALLY tile the area without gaps or overlaps using copies of the given polysquare.

THE PROGRAM WILL DO EVERYTHING ELSE FULLY AUTOMATICALLY! Given a shape and a tile to fill it with, in general it is not known whether such a tiling problem has a solution. 'Backtrack' gives you the answers and lets you watch as the computer plays with the tiles.  The game demonstrates tree search by backtracking.You can invent new puzzles all the time and - best of all - let Zillions solve them automatically and in front of your eyes. If it cannot place a tile, the program tries to rearrange the tile previously placed and so on.There is even some 'intelligence' build in. E.g., if the computer finds an isolated unoccupied square anywhereon the board, it will backtrack and try other possibilities for placing a tile.Furthermore, some options have tile-specific optimisation routines built in, which have the effect that not all possible orientations will actually be tried out.Such optimisations can be very easily created for any tile.(If you change to code to improve it, remember that this zrf is designed for ANY given shape to be filled, not only for rectangles!)  The system will stop (win) when it has found a tiling, and also stop (lose) if there is no tiling for the given shape.

In the default variant ten billiard balls are randomly dropped. They roll across the billiard table orthogonally or diagonally. The reflective border of the table is artificially 'roughened' and hence rebounces the balls not always correctly. (This may also reflect the 'spin' of the balls). This gives the scene a more random behaviour. When one ball hits another ball, it is bounced off sideways. Other variants: In some variants more balls are automatically dropped or you have to drop a certain number of balls yourself before they start rolling. Some variants have a smooth table border, where the balls rebounce always correctly.Finally, there are 18 variants playing on a smaller board.  Note that the moves list is switched off for performance reasons.This game needs Zillions V2.0 (or higher) to run.  'Billiard Balls' is one of the few Zillions games which actually use 'animation'. Other games which use animation are Turing Machine I and II and several puzzle solving games like the Backtrack series, but the movements are not as smooth as in this game. Maybe this game will encourage other authors to experiment more with animation in Zillions.

{"zrfID":982,"id":"botany","name":"Botany","creatorIDs":[82],"creator":"Ben Tichy","created":"2004-04-10","description":["Object: Capture Opponent's Heart tile.","Botany is a Zillions adaptation of a two-player tile game. Each player begins with a Heart-tile face down in the center of the playing area. The rest of the 120 tiles begin in an off-screen reservoir managed by the computer dealer. The front of each tile is divided into 2 squares. The Heart-tile is divided into a Face-square and Heart-square. The other tiles are divided into Base-squares (distinguished by color -- Red, Yellow, Green, Blue) and Class-squares (Cross, Skull, Attacker, or Star). The significance of these squares will be explained later. The back of each tile (colored black) is considered Void and is not divided into squares. The significance of Void and Non-void will be explained later.","Botany is a turn-based game, with each turn divided into three phases indicated by colored letters which appear at the top center of the game board. The green circle symbol at the bottom of the screen is the button which starts a game. The red stop-sign symbol which replaces it is a button which ends the current phase and begins the next.","The first phase is the Void Phase (indicated by a green 'V'). During this phase the player may void tiles which are in play. If a player's Heart-tile is voided, it is unvoided at the start of this phase (the Heart-tile is the only tile which unvoids). At the start of the game the first player's Heart-tile unvoids and the computer dealer deals 5 tiles into the space at the bottom of the screen representing the player's 'hand'. If the Void-phase begins with the Heart-tile unvoided the computer deals one tile. Since there are no tiles in play except the Heart-tile at the start of the game, the first player can only void the Heart-tile (which would result in the discard of the 'hand' tiles) or pass to the next phase. The advantage of voiding tiles is that doing so often makes the tile harder to destroy (see Attack Phase below), eliminates potential connection conflicts (see Play Phase below), or -- in the case of Cross-tiles -- grants an extra tile draw. The disadvantage is that voided tiles cannot form connections with other tiles (see Play-phase below) and can only remain in play while adjacent to at least one Non-void square.","The second phase is the Attack Phase (indicated by a yellow 'A'). During this phase the player may perform an attack on the other player using attack-capable tiles in play. As mentioned before, tiles are organized into classes and certain classes -- Skull, Attacker, Star -- have the ability to perform attacks. An attack is performed by detaching an attack-capable tile in play and repositioning it adjacent to the desired target tile(s) on the opposing player's side of the board. Only one attack may be performed per Attack Phase but there is no limit to the number of eligible tiles which may participate. Eligible tiles are attack-capable tiles which are in play at the start of the Attack Phase. The result of an attack depends on the offensive properties of the attacking tiles and the defensive properties of the targeted tiles. All 3 exposed sides of a Star-tile will destroy targeted Non-void squares (and associated tiles). The exposed tip of an Attacker-tile will destroy targeted Void or Non-void squares (and associated tiles), while the remaining 2 exposed sides will destroy targeted Non-void squares  (and associated tiles). All 3 exposed sides of a Skull-tile will destroy targeted Void and Non-void squares (and associated tiles). Voided tiles, the 2 sides of the Attacker-square, all 3 exposed sides of the Star-square, and all 3 exposed sides of a Face-square are considered Void for defensive purposes. (The exception with the Face-square is that a player may 'deflect' an attack by discarding a tile in hand). Attacking tiles are deployed by first clicking the desired tile and dragging it into the 'roundabout' located at the bottom of the screen (the 'X' with radiating arrows). When the attacking tile is properly re-oriented, the player clicks the square adjacent to the desired target tile(s) on the opponent's side of the board. After all of the attacking tiles have been positioned, the attacks are resolved in any order, as if they occured simultaneously. All destroyed and attacking tiles are discarded. A player may use the Heart-tile in an attack if there are no tiles attached to it. It functions as a Star-tile and returns to its 'home' position after the attack. During the Attack Phase the player may also detach and discard any unwanted tiles in play.","The third phase is the Play Phase (indicated by a red 'P'). During this phase the player may take tiles in 'hand' and put them into play. The rule for putting tiles into play is that their Base-square must lie adjacent to a white Class-square (Heart-square or Cross-square) or same-colored Base-square already in play. Different colored Base-squares may not lie adjacent. Tiles are put into play using the same drag-and-drop method used in the Attack Phase. The end of the Play Phase marks the end of the player's turn and the start of the opponent's Void Phase etc. Play continues until the capture of one of the Heart-tiles."],"image":"game982_scr_Botany.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[1,11],"variations":0}

Digits are used instead of colours. The computer chooses a pattern of four digits. In the standard variant it uses digits 1-6. Duplicates are allowed, so the computer could even choose the same four code digits. To invoke a random hidden code, press 'Start Thinking'. The chosen pattern is placed upmost but hidden to the player. If you give up and want to view the code, press 'Switch Piece Set'.","The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and correct digit, within nine turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code digits on the decoding board. Once placed, the computer provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs at the sideboard. A black key peg is placed for each code digit from the guess which is correct in both digit and position; a white peg indicates the existence of a correct digit placed in the wrong position. The black pegs are always placed leftmost, so there is no correlation of position. Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or nine incorrect guesses are made. If you can keep an average of five or below in the standard variant, then you are good. An inexperienced player can begin at the easiest level where only digits 1-4 are used in the code. You should turn off 'Moves List' in order not to cheat inadverdently .","Mastermind or Master Mind is a simple code-breaking board game for two players, invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. A similar pencil and paper game, called bulls and cows, was played at least as far back as the early 1960's (Wikipedia).","With 4 positions and 6 digits, there are 64 = 1296 different patterns. In 1977, Donald Knuth demonstrated that an algoritm can solve the pattern in five moves or fewer, using an algorithm that progressively reduces the number of possible patterns (Wikipedia)."],"image":"game1574_scr_Codebreaker.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[36,11],"variations":5}

Digits are used instead of colours. The computer chooses a pattern of five digits. In the standard variant it uses digits 1-6. Duplicates are allowed, so the computer could even choose the same five digits. To invoke a random hidden code, press 'Start Thinking'. The chosen pattern is placed upmost but hidden to the player. If you give up and want to view the code, press 'Switch Piece Set'.","The codebreaker must try to guess the pattern, in both order and correct digit, within nine turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code digits on the decoding board (just press on a square in the lowermost row). Once placed, the program provides feedback by placing from zero to five key pegs at the sideboard. A black key peg is placed for each digit from the guess which is correct in both digit and position. A white peg indicates that a correct digit is placed in the wrong position. The black pegs are always placed leftmost, so there is no correlation of position. Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or nine incorrect guesses are made. An inexperienced player can begin at the easiest level where only digits 1-5 are used in the code. You should turn off 'Moves List' in order not to cheat inadverdently .","Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking board game for two players, invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. A similar pencil and paper game, called bulls and cows, was played at least as far back as the early 1960's (Wikipedia). With 5 positions and 6 digits, there are 65 = 7776 different patterns. You can try out different solutions by placing a digit on the board. As long as you haven't placed all five of them, you can retract the digit. The standard version, with variants, has also been implemented (see Codebreaker).","See also my homepage."],"image":"game2065_scr_ExpertCodebreaker.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[36,11],"variations":2}

Given a shape and a tile to fill it with, it is in general not known whether such a tiling problem has a solution. This game gives you the answers (if Zillions does not run out of memory) and lets you watch as the computer plays with the tiles.  YOU CAN GIVE THE COMPUTER ANY SHAPE MADE FROM SQUARES.

Hence for each shape that is 'rectifiable' (i.e. which can tile a rectangle), it is an interesting task to find all prime rectangles ('primes') for this tile. For any given tile there can only be a finite number of such rectangles. For the G-hexomino we present here all known prime rectangles small enough to fit onto our board of size 32x32.  The G-hexomino is represented by six square tokens. The system will automatically change the colour of the tokens after you have put down a tile.  The system helps you to place a tile: Place two squares side by side, then a third orthogonally next to the second. The system will drop the remaining two squares automatically.  You can DELETE a placed hexomino by simply clicking the three squares which you placed on the board when you created the tile.  You win if you manage to fill the given rectangle.

{"zrfID":1198,"id":"i-ching","name":"I Ching","implementerIDs":[380],"implementer":"Mats Winther","created":"2006-03-11","description":["This is not a game. It is the ancient Chinese divinatory system of 'I Ching', or 'Book of Changes'. The origin of the I Ching hexagrams date back more than 3000 years. Originally, during the Shang dynasty, the soothsayers used bones that were thrown into the fire. From cracks in the bones they were able to forecast the future. The broken and whole cracks are extant in I Ching as the whole lines (Yang), and the broken lines (Yin).","To question the oracle you must throw the long dice six times. These dice have only two numbers: two and three. To throw the dice, click on the upmost die. If the Yin numbers (the twos) are in majority then a Yin line (broken) will be produced. If the Yang numbers (the threes) are in majority, then a Yang line (whole) will be produced. Six throws are necessary to determine a hexagram. A number pops up, which is the number of the I Ching hexagram. To read what it has to say, right-click on the number and choose \"Properties\". A hexagram consist of two trigrams. The headings \"Above\" and \"Below\" reflect upon these. Under the heading \"The Lines\" you can read what the strong lines mean. A strong Yin line (a \"Six\") has a cross on it. A strong Yang line (a \"Nine\") has a circle on it. To question the oracle again, click on \"New game\".","Under the hexagram number there appears a 'C'. Right-click on it and you can read the comments of King Wan and Duke of Kau. Whereas the hexagram text derives from the Wilhelm translation, the comments are taken from the Legge translation. This is an ideal combination. The comments in the Wilhelm translation are somewhat prosaic, which is not suitable for this spiritual book. Remember that the hexagram is more important than the commentators' texts. It is your associations that count, that is, it is you who should write the comment. This is also Palmer/Ramsay's standpoint in 'I Ching - The Shamanic Oracle of Change' (1995).","I Ching contains much wisdom. It is well worth reading like a regular book. Its obscure language is typical for oracles (compare the oracle at Delphi, etc). Such obscure imagery can entice projections from the unconscious. It is well-known that the unconscious often carries solutions to our problems, as exemplified by the chemist Kekulé, who found the ring structure of benzene in a dream. A more prosaic explanation is that a comment of any sort has the capacity of breaking one's habitual thinking, and make one see things differently. Nigel Pennick, however, in \"Games of the Gods\", argues that any divinatory system reflects upon the state of the universe at this very moment. He builds this notion on C.G. Jung's concept of synchronicity. Be that as it may, divinatory systems do actually work, one way or another.","If you want to, you can edit the zrf-file, add comments, or insert improvements of the translation. There is much information on the I Ching to be found on the Internet. A curiosity is that G.W. Leibniz (1646-1716) read a Latin version of the I Ching. It was then that he got the idea of the binary system. The hexagrams are actually binary representations, if the broken lines are understood as 0 and the whole lines as 1. The binary system is what underlies the computer age. Thanks to this invention Leibniz was able to design a computer, but he was never able to fabricate it."],"image":"game1198_scr_I_Ching.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[9,11],"variations":0}

Altogether we had nine weeks available. To make the schedule most comfortable for the participants a flexible approach was tested: Before the start each team was allowed to nominate three weeks in which the team was not willing to play. The hope was that nevertheless a complete time table would be realizable. Indeed, things went well. The 2002 schedule was made by hand, and only recently the idea rose to design a Zillions scheduler for the task. In this Zillions realisation there are three actors:   (i) The ''User'' enters all the time-out wishes.   (ii) The ''Scheduler'' makes the schedule.   (iii) The ''Controller'' controls if the schedule is ok. The standard setting is that the Zillions engine has the role of Scheduler and Controller. However, Zillions is not a perfect Scheduler. So it makes sense to try interactive approaches. For instance, the human may create a partial starting schedule and let Zillions complete it.","There have been Jenazon Cups in 2001 and 2002.

This will cause parts A and B to swap layers at those intersections: If A was on top of B before, it will run underneath it afterwards and vice versa.

These manipulations all simulate the natural behaviour of a real rope; e.g., you cannot break it by moving it around, only lengthen, shorten and shape it. Most manipulations are more or less straight forward. No help texts are given; explore!  We will only describe the least obvious manipulations here:","When a top-layer part A of the string crosses a straight piece B of string twice (twice on top or twice on the bottom), you can move one of the two intersections P and Q onto the other (where P, A, Q, B are ordered clockwise). This will cause parts A and B to swap layers at those intersections: If A was on top of B before, it will run underneath it afterwards and vice versa. Both manipulations are only admissible when all crossings that lie between P and Q are ones which run UNDERNEATH line B). Two similar manipulations are available if part A lies at the lowest level.","To pass a loose rope end underneath an orthogonal line, move the end onto the line. The end will automatically be lengthened towards the next free position. If you overshot or if there are several lines crossing, and you want to pass under all of them, you can move the loose end back to the intersection which you want to pass under.","You win when the knots on both boards have the same shape and position. This game is very well suited to just play around with strings and to explore. (The topic of knots and their classificaton is quite an interesting one, both in sailing and in mathematics).  Please note that there are SEVEN alternative piece sets available, with very different graphic effects. Try them out!  The variants are lumped into four groups:","'Open Knots' - knots containing at least one string with loose ends","'Unknotted Loops' - knots which can be shaped from a simple O-ring.","'Knotted Loops' - knots made from a closed string which cannot be turned into a simple O-ring.","'Multiple Loops' - knots made from multiple loops","'Freeplay' - Use a larger board; here you do not have to solve a puzzle, just play freely with the rope. The freeplay variants sometimes cause a 'too many moves generated' message. In these cases try to keep your string in a smaller area at first.Variant 'Freeplay 1': one piece of string given. Variant 'Freeplay 2': two pieces of string given. Variant 'Freeplay 3 (easy)': This is the most luxurious variant of Knots II. It is designed to create and manipulate knots very fast. Some features available in this variant are withheld from all other variants to make the puzzles more challenging.Extra features in Freeplay 3:","You can cut the string into any number of pieces (move straight onto adjacent straight).","You can turn upside a (top-layer or bottom-layer) self-intersecting string part simply by clicking the intersection.","This game works best with SMART MOVES turned OFF!

The following text assumes that you are familiar with the game 'Knots II', hence most information given there will not be repeated here. Knots III uses the same string manipulations as Knots II.Knots III has been especially designed for large Knots.  Because of the size of the board, the knots you have to recreate are not displayed on a separate board as in Knots II, but rather as background image on the same board. As a further help, a smaller copy of the target knot is displayed on the lower right.  You win if you can recreate the given knot.  Variants 1 - 5 : These are Knots which I had designed once for the wire-and-string puzzles which I produce and sell in several sizes, from 3 to 30 cm diameter. (Version 2.0 of the original game 'Knots' also contains some of my designs.) Here you have to create the wire-part of these puzzles from a small loop; the string has been omitted.Variants 6 - 14 : similar to variants 1 - 4, but the string (second loop) has to be attached as well. This makes the construction more difficult. (Note that in the actual wire puzzles the task is rather the opposite of the task given here; in the real puzzles you have to the string out without bending the wire. This task will be tackled by the game 'Knots 4'.)  There are also several freeplay-variants with a blank board: Variant 'Freeplay 1': one small loop given.Variant 'Freeplay 2': one piece of string given. Variant 'Freeplay 3': two pieces of string given. Variant 'Freeplay 4 (easy)': This is the most luxurious variant of Knots III. It is designed to create and manipulate knots very fast.

Only the options DOT and INSERT let you select an icon and place it onto a single position of the board. DOT option has overwrite mode: the icon will replace an existing piece of graph. In all other modes (except DECO LINE) the system will (try to) add lines and curves without deleting existing ones. INSERT mode is like DOT, but :  - you have to select one of the eight most simple pieces (horizontal line, vertical line, diagonals,    and 4 simple curves, marked green) to inserta line piece without overwriting.  - if any other graph piece is selected, you can only draw to an empty position.   DELETE mode: click a position to delete its content. RED mode: click a board position to toggle between red and black colour.   The SQUARE/RECTANGLE/BOX drawing modes do not use the selected image from the selection menu, but rather draw the outlines of a square/rectangle/rectangle-with-rounded-corners. The BOX mode draws a rectangle with ROUND CORNERS if the chosen width or length is greater than 1 unit. Always mark the top left corner first, then the lower right corner!   The SQUARE/RECTANGLE/BOX/LINE/DOTTEDLINE/POLYLINE drawing modes do not overwrite the existing drawing, but rather add lines, just as one would expect from a line drawing program. If possible, avoid crossing two curves on one position because only a few such cases are implemented (note that there are only a few icons for this in the selection menu, marked yellow). Apart from this, all possible line/line, curve/curve and curve/line combinations are implemented.   In the drawing modes SQUARE/RECTANGLE/BOX/LINE/DOTTEDLINE/POLYLINE the chosen from-position, if not-empty, is highlighted in red colour.   When using POLYLINE, remember that you have to finish the polyline before you can select another mode. To finish a polyline, you either:  - click the red end piece of your polyline    This will paint the last missing segment in most cases, therefor strongly recommended.  - or click the POLYLINE button, which simply paints the red to-position black,    but which may leave the last graph piece undrawn. The POLYLINE concept has not been fully developed in this game, which the result that some automatically created corner pieces are placed in overwrite mode.   DECO-LINE fills a line with the selected icon.   Hint : Hit F7 regularly, e.g., to see where you can place the lower right corner of a square. Please note that there are eight pieceset/board combinations available!      'Linedraw' has been developed from the (now redundant) variant 2 of the Zillions game 'Draw'. Because of its greatly increased amount of code, versatility and imagery, as well of its changed focus, Linedraw is now a game on its own. It also has an increased board space of 30x30 position, and loads much faster.   Linedraw has quite a bit of 'intelligence' built in to make it work as expected, (when it tries not to overwrite existing graph, and for the polyline).

{"zrfID":1519,"id":"marquand-logic-machine","name":"Marquand Logic Machine","implementerIDs":[372],"implementer":"Greg Schmidt","inventorIDs":[421],"inventor":"Allan Marquand","created":"2007-12-15","description":["HISTORY:","In 1881, Princeton Professor Allan Marquand constructed a machine capable of solving simple problems in formal logic.  It was made from the wood of a red cedar post from Princeton's oldest homestead.  The machine displays all valid implications of a simple logical proposition by using an arrangement of rods, levers, catgut strings, and spiral springs.  Later, Marquand diagrammed an electrical circuit for his machine that became known as the first design for an electric logic machine.","THEORY:","In effect, the machine displays a truth table in accordance with the logical premises entered into it.  An interesting aspect of the machine is that the premises must be input in the negative form.  In this way, the machine eliminates any conclusions which contradict the premises.  The machine can handle up to four terms labeled A, B, C, \u0026 D.  The negation of these terms are represented by the corresponding lowercase letters a, b, c, \u0026 d.  The sixteen possible combinations of these four terms are represented by the sixteen rotating pointers.  The labeling on the top and right sides indicate the term associated with the pointer.  Starting from the top left and moving right, the terms are ABCD, AbCD, and aBcD.  The lower right corner corresponds to abcd.  A left pointing pointer indicates that the corresponding term is 'true', whereas a downward pointing pointer indicates 'false'. When the machine is reset, all pointers initially point left indicating that all terms start out being assumed true.","OPERATION:","There are ten keys near the bottom face of the machine.  Pressing the '1' key resets the machine by setting all pointers to 'true' (pointing left).  Each premise contains two terms, for example consider the premise 'A IMPLIES B'.  This can be restated in a negative form by saying that a true A cannot combine with a false B.  In other words, all combinations containing Ab must be eliminated.  This can easily be entered into the machine by first pressing A, then pressing b, followed by pressing the '0' key (the 'destruction' key).  Once this is done, all pointers corresponding to a term containing Ab will point down indicating that these terms are false.  This process is continued until all premises have been entered.  When complete, the final state of the pointers reflect the remaining combinations which are consistent with the premises.  The following example best illustrates this process.","EXAMPLE:","Marquand stated the following problem: Let us suppose there are four girls at school, Anna, Bertha, Cora, and Dora, and that someone had observed that: (1) Whenever either Anna or Bertha (or both) remained at home, Cora was at home; and (2) When Bertha was out, Anna was out; and (3) Whenever Cora was at home, Anna was at home. What information is conveyed here concerning Dora?","Let the A, B, C, \u0026 D terms stand for the four girls, where each term corresponds to the first letter of a girl's name. A capital letter indicates 'at home', a lowercase letter indicates the negation, 'not at home'.  Putting the above into logical form we have:","1. ( A OR B ) IMPLIES C 2. NOT B IMPLIES NOT A 3. C IMPLIES A","Putting these into the negative form using Marquand's notation yields:","1.1\tAc = 0 1.2\tBc = 0 2.\tbA = 0 3.\tCa = 0","After entering these premises into the machine, we examine the pointers to see what can be inferred about Dora.","The following left facing (true) pointers which include the D term are ABCD and abcD.  In other words, when Dora is at home, the other girls are either all at home or either all out.","Also the following left facing (true) pointers which include the d term are ABCd and abcd.  A similar conclusion can be drawn as before.  In other words, when Dora is out, the other girls are either all at home or either all out.","REFERENCES:","Logic Machines and Diagrams - Martin Gardner","http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/attic2/attic2_087.html","NOTE:","A stand-alone Axiom version is available, please email me for details (see included ReadMe.txt for address)."],"category":"solitaire","themes":[24,11,39],"variations":0}

The first 16 variants MAX-Solver are pure tiling problems. They do not require the MAX-game rule saying that only three colours are allowed and that adjacent tiles must differ in colour. In the second set of 16 variants, with the same shapes to be filled, MAX-Solver obeys this special MAX rule. In this second set you can select a special 'TURBO' mode to accelerate the search 10 times and more. However, in some cases the turbo mode may finish quickly and not find a solution at all when in fact there is one. But it is always worth trying out the turbo mode first.  The MAX pentiamond tile is represented here by five coloured dots. (This greatly reduces the complexity of the program; in the original MAX game the tiles where properly drawn as joined triangles.)  Given a shape and a set of tiles to fill it with, it is in general not known whether such a tiling problem has a solution. MAX-Solver allows you to try any given shape, and there are many discoveries still waiting to be made!  Select 'T0' with the right mouse button to add a dot to the board. Always choose the center of a triangle (corners are unused positions). Select 'empty' with the right mouse button to delete a position.  NOTE: you can speed up MAX-Solver by switching off the sound (menu option VIEW/OPTIONS/SOUND).   Due to the fact that in Zillions the number of possible moves is limited, MAX-Solver might not solve all given shapes. The larger the given shape, the more moves are necessary to find a solution.  Mathematically the MAX puzzle is interesting because the special 3-colour-rule uses only three colours, not the minimum of four colours that is normally required for colouring maps (compare 4-colour-theorem)!

For each pentomino type, you can determine whether the computer should use no tile, one tile or many (unlimited) tiles. Just click '0', '1' or 'M' for any of the twelve types displayed at the top.  Given a shape and a set of tiles to fill it with, it is in general not known whether such a tiling problem has a solution. (For example, which pentominoes or pairs of pentominoes tile the doughnut shape given in the default variant?) Pento-Solver allows you to try any combination of pentominoes for any given shape, and there are many discoveries still waiting to be made!  You can give the computer any shape made from squares. Select 'T0' with the right mouse button to add a square to the board.  Finally, click one of the two text bars to let the computer tile the given playing area automatically. The left button saying 'Fixed Colours' means that each pentomino type has its own, fixed colour. The right button saying 'Sequential Colours' means that the colour will change with each tile placed, the colours being from a series of 16 colours. This is especially useful when you use only very few types of tiles.  NOTE: YOU CAN SPEED UP PENTO-SOLVER THREEFOLD by switching off the sound (menu option VIEW/OPTIONS/SOUND).

Mirrors and 'junction/splitter' elements control the flow of the photons. Red and yellow mirrors change their orientation when hit.We will see that we can build all parts of a computer from these elements, and that in fact THE JUNCTION/SPLITTER ELEMENTS ARE THE ONLY ONES WE REALLY NEED! (See below and variants for details on this fact.)","The default variant shows how such a setup can be used to create a binary counter: The mirrors on red background represent the binary digit Zero, the mirrors on yellow background the binary digit One. Hit the run button to see how the setup counts in binary: 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101... (Read the numbers when the photon is back on the bottom line).Note: In variants with more than one photon, the run button has to be green to read the results properly! It will turn green regularly.","To drop a photon or edit the board, click one of the icons on the right. The associated letters will remind you of what the icons mean: P : photon (default: facing north). Click board several times to make it change direction. If two photons collide on an empty position, they eliminate each other. If two photons collide on an occupied position, only one will survive.D : mirror sloping DOWNU : mirror sloping UP F : mirror flips when hit by a photon from sloping up to sloping down and vice versa. J : Junction/Splitter : Incoming photons are guided into direction of the arrow; however, photons traveling towards the arrow will be split, one to each side. B : The BLOCK captures a photon.D : The DELAY stops the photon for one tick. C : CLEAR a position.","These gadgets can be dropped one by one (option 'point') or in a line (option 'line'). Use option 'shift' to move icons around on the board.When you are finished editing the board, hit one of the run buttons.","The variants show applications of the photonworld system. For more information read the game description of the variants.","The Photonworld presented here is a new system of elements which allows us to build all components of a computer. With ease we can build all logical gates and many other machines simply from fixed (!) mirrors, junctions and splitters.","The pair of flip-flop mirrors usually can be made redundant (for example for 8-cycle data) and be replaced by a more complicated setup of junction/splitter elements. This is demonstrated in some of the variants. The flip-flop mirrors are very convenient, however, to keep constructions simple. Moreover, all fixed mirrors can be replaced by junction/splitter elements (the construction may be have to be changed, though).","Blocks are redundant since a block can be constructed using a junction and three mirrors. Delays are necessary for odd types of data streams, because mirrors only allow delaying a data stream by an even number of ticks, which is sufficient for 2-, 4-, 6-cycle data etc.","The simplicity of the constructions is also helped by the fact that the photon data streams in this system can cross each other without interference (as long as they are kept out of step). Hence in Photonworld no special gadgetry is necessary to care for intersections, which is in stark contrast to many other systems.","If you find other interesting setups for this game, you can email them to me and I might include them in future versions of this game.","More freeware and real puzzles and games at my homepage: http://karl.kiwi.gen.nz."],"image":"game1003_scr_Photonworld.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[24,11],"variations":49}

The host now turns to you and says:   \"I know where that fruitcake is and I can tell you it's not  behind door no. 1.\"  He opens door no. 1 to reveal nothing  behind it.  \"But,\" he continues, \"I'm going to give you the  opportunity to change your pick to door no. 3.\"","The question is, should you change your pick to door no. 3?","There is a right answer to this question and a wrong answer.   If you make the right choice, your odds of finding the  fruitcake are two in three.  If you make the wrong choice,  your odds are one in three.","Many people find this result baffling.  There are two doors  remaining, so the odds must be fifty-fifty that the fruitcake  is behind each.  But this reasoning is flawed.","Picador gives you an opportunity to figure out the correct  answer through experiment.  You play the game by first  selecting the door you think the fruitcake is behind.   Zillions will then automatically open one of the other doors,  which will always be a door with no fruitcake behind it.  You  can then keep your original choice or change your pick to the  other unopened door.  If you find the fruitcake, you score a  hit.

They can move freely over the empty spaces (light purple) but are (usually)  blocked by the walls. The walls come in 5 colors: red, blue, yellow, green,  and brown. The quanta cannot be moved individually, but can only by moved  simultaneously in a synchronized manner. The object of the puzzle is to make  all of the quanta disappear. (Note: the squares of the board are adjacent  orthogonally only. There is no diagonal movement.)","At the bottom of the board is a row of 14 buttons. You play the puzzle by  clicking on the buttons, not by moving the pieces. Click on one of the 4 light  blue buttons with arrows at the right end of the row to move all unblocked  quanta in the direction of the arrow. Quanta are blocked by walls and any  other blocked quanta, but not by moving quanta. This means that if one quantum  in a row of adjacent quanta can move, then all of the others will move with it  in sequence. Next in the button row (moving to the left) are 4 orange buttons  with arrows. Clicking on one of these will cause all of the quanta which are  blocked by a wall (only) to make a quantum jump over the wall, provided there  is an empty space on the other side, or another jumping quantum (but not a  stationary one). Again, this allows an entire sequence of quanta, separated by  walls, to jump together. Next are 2 purple buttons with double arrows. Clicking  on one of these causes every quantum which is adjacent to another quantum in the  given orientation (horizontal or vertical) to disappear. Finally, at the left end  of the row are 4 colored buttons (blue, red, yellow, green) with black X's.  Clicking on one of these causes all quanta which are adjacent to a wall of the  corresponding color to disappear. (The brown walls are inert.)","The most important rule of the puzzle is that each of the 10 leftmost buttons can  be clicked only once, after which it is blacked-out.

{"zrfID":7,"id":"rule-110","name":"Rule 110","creatorIDs":[6],"creator":"W. D. Troyka","created":"2003-01-25","description":["Rule 110 is a cellular automaton, similar to John Conway's Game of Life, which has been scripted by Karl Scherer (Alive and Alive_Auto), as well as by Robert Price (Game of Life). Rule 110 has recently gained attention as a result of a book written by Stephen Wolfram, known in mathematics circles as the author of the software program Mathematica. The book, called a New Kind of Science, suggests that both space and time can be modeled by cellular automata such that a relatively simple set of rules governing the content of a cell might lead to the actual complexity that we experience in the physical world. A cell in this case would be a discrete unit of space, itself spread into discrete units along a time axis, with rules governing its transition from one state to another based on the properties of neighboring cells.  As an example of how simple rules governing cellular automata can lead to complex structures, Wolfram analyzes the basic cellular automata created on a square grid when the rule governing the color of a square (white or black) depends solely on the colors of the three squares above to the northwest, north, and northeast. There are eight possible combinations of colors for these three squares. Because each of these combinations can be defined as causing the cell under consideration to be either white or black, there are a total of 256 (2 to the 8th) possible rules.  Most of these rules do not lead to interesting results. Rule 110, however, if applied to a sufficiently large graph, begins to generate complex irregular structures that do not appear to be predictable from the input row -- the top row of the graph -- or the rule governing coloring. Rule 110 states that a cell remains white if the three squares above are all white, all black, or black-white-white. Otherwise it is colored black. Wolfram purports to show that Rule 110 is a universal computer because it can emulate a universal Turing Machine. (The Turing Machine has also been coded by Karl Scherer). This means that any calculation capable of being performed by any mechanical method, i.e., on any computer, can be performed with Rule 110 using a suitably chosen input row and sufficiently long graph, with the output appearing in a designated bottom row.  This rules file allows you to run iterations of Rule 110, or any of the other 255 rules, with any chosen input row. The graphs come in sizes 10x10, 25x25, 50x50, 80x80, and 100x100. The larger graphs may take several seconds to load. This script departs from the technical definition of Rule 110 because the rows are considered to wrap around the horizontal edges. If you run the default setting once, you will get a technically correct Rule 110 graph through one iteration. For most rules and input rows, however, the first iteration will involve some wraparound effect. Subsequent iterations are always affected. The wraparound is a necessary compromise to make the graph presentable for a large number of rows. The graph also wraps around from bottom to top in successive iterations. This does not affect the accuracy of the rules but merely replaces older rows with newer ones.  For details on how to use this program, please consult the strategy section under the Help menu."],"category":"solitaire","themes":[24,11],"variations":5}

The sailor Piet Hein is on heavy seas and you have to help him to get back home.  Before you play this game, it is recommended that you play Sailing II first.  The game Sailing III starts at the lower left square and ends at the top right square. The squares are colour-coded. The colours tell you where you go next (pushed by strong currents and heavy winds):","A dark red square (with an arrow pointing up) tells you to move straight ahead.","A purple square (with a left arrow) tells you to turn left (relative to where you came from).","A light green square (with a right arrow) tells you to turn right 4 (relative to where you came from).","A blue square (with a down arrow) tells you to turn straight back to where you came from.","A light red square is similar to a T-intersection: it tells you to turn left or right (relative to where you came from).The other colours work similarly. The little arrows help you along, but remember that they only show directions indirectly! You always have to watch where you came from.  For the start, we assume that the sailing boat arrived at the scene from the left. E.g. if it sits at the start on a 'Forward' square (with upward arrow), then we have to move it from square a1 to b1.

But if you slip up, it will become impossible to push every stone where it goes.","The name comes from the myth of Sisyphus, a king in Greek mythology who was condemned in Tartarus to roll a stone up a hill again and again.  Each time he got it to the top of the hill, it would roll down, and he would have to walk back down and push it up again.  In this game, Sisyphus has moved on to push stones around Sokoban style mazes.  When he finishes one maze, he has another to do.","Sokoban was invented in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, the president of THINKING RABBIT Inc. JAPAN.","Sisyphus comes with 25 original mazes, a solution for each maze, a variety of background images, a level editor ZRF (sisyphus-edit.zrf), a wall-pattern generating ZRF (sisyphus-auto.zrf), and a program (sokovert.exe) for converting between file formats.  This will turn the ZSG files from the level editor into ZRF code for playing the level, and it will turn ZSG files from sisyphus-auto.zrf into ZSG files that can be fed into the level editor.  It will also convert between other Sokoban maze formats, including the Bulldozer format and the popular XSokoban format.  So you can use the level editor to create mazes for other Sokoban programs or use sokovert to adapt mazes in other formats for Sisyphus.  Most of my mazes were created with the Bulldozer level editor, and the later ones were created with the Sisyphus level editor.  The very latest were based on patterns of walls randomly generated by sisyphus-auto.zrf.  All mazes were converted to ZRF format with the aid of sokovert.  The maze shown below was hand-designed with the level editor."],"category":"solitaire","themes":[6,11],"variations":25}

A Turing Machine is the most basic type of a computer. Input and output data are stored on the same linear storage, called a 'tape'. Along the tape a 'read/write head' is moving which reads, the writes one signal at a time.The program consists of a matrix which for each possible data read by the read/write head and for each 'inner state' (column of the matrix) has three data stored:- a new state for the machine- an output signal to write back onto the tape - a direction into which the head has to move next.In principle, any program in the world can be processed this way.  Click GO to let the game guide you through the steps of the Turing Machine cycles. Or click run to let the Turing Machine compute nonstop until it has finished the calculation.  The default variant has a string of Ones on the tape, and the program matrix is designed so that the Turing Machine converts it into a binary number.  The input/output string in this game alows only five different characters to be used in the input string: blank, 0, 1, =, *.However, the real meaning of these signs is up to you. The program itself gives these signs the true meaning. The star, for example, can stand for any mathematical operator.  Variant 2: add two binary numbers.Variant 3: subtract two binary numbers.Variant 4: copy a binary number. Variant 5: double a binary number. Variant 6: empty program, for you to encode.  All programs and tapes are fully editable by you; just click the entries. Rightclick the matrix state entries (letters) for more information. Hence just by clicking you can reprogram this Turing Machine and make it do what you want.Also vary the input for the given programs and see what happens.   The Turing Machine is named after Alan Turing, who was one of the founders of modern computer and information theory and investigated into the possibilities of this machine.  In principle the tape has infinite length at least at one end.More characters than 5 allowed for the input would request a larger matrix.The number of states (matrix files) also changes with the program.  In 1986 I built a mechanical Turing machine from a metal construction set, plastic pipes, strings, springs, and pieces of wood. Clicking 'GO' in this Zillions game, which leads you through the process in small steps, was thus replaced by pulling 12 strings, one after the other, proving that some old Greek scientist already could have built a computer!

Troyka","created":"2002-03-30","description":["This is a collection of Turn Off variants in which the pattern of light changes correspond to the moves of various fairy chess pieces. In the standard Turn Off that comes with Zillions, when a light is selected, it and all orthogonally adjacent lights change state. This corresponds to the Wazir fairy piece, which can move to any orthogonally adjacent piece. Variants included in this file feature the Wazir, Fers, Dabbaba, Ferdaba, Alfil, Squirrel, Camel, and Zebra. A description of the moves of each piece is included in the \"game description\" section. Each game starts with all lights on, and the goal is to turn them all off.  Curiously, the Zillions version of Turn Off does not include a variant that starts with all the lights on. It turns out that this is a very difficult puzzle. In my experience Zillions has been unable to find the solution on the higher settings. Set to \"stupid\" it will sometimes find a solution by accident but usually after several hundred moves.  So the challenge is: Find the efficient solution to the Wazir 5x5 Turn Off puzzle. You can cheat all you want. The first person to send me the correct answer at dtroyka@justice.com gets a certified smiley emoticon. :-)  Wazir Challenge is a companion game to Royal Turnoff.  UPDATE: Robert Gauss and Jeff Roy both solved this puzzle the week it came out. We all agree that the shortest solution is in 15 moves. This solution is now included with the game in a Solutions folder, which you can also access through the \"Show Solution\" option in the Help menu.  The order in which lights are selected is irrelevant because the state of a light -- off or on -- depends solely on how many times it or a neighboring light has been selected, not on the order of selection. A priori it is clear that the optimal solution cannot be over 25 turns. Selecting a light twice is the same as not selecting it at all (the second click undoes the first click), so an efficient solution cannot contain multiple selections of the same light.  Jeff Roy provided an interesting proof that the largest number of turns in the efficient solution to any solvable 5x5 Wazir puzzle is 17 turns. (By efficient I mean that all doublets have been subtracted out and that each light is selected either once or not at all.) He identified a \"return pattern\" of 16 distinct lights that, when selected, returns the board to the starting pattern so that no change in board state occurs. This pattern is a2, a3, a4, b1, b3, b5, c1, c2, c4, c5, d1, d3, d5, e2, e3, and e4. To summarize the proof: Suppose there is an efficient path of 18 moves from an initial state to a final state. A player could then add the 16 lights in the return pattern, which would create a list of 34 moves leading from the initial state to the final state. In this list of 34 moves there must be at least 9 doublets because there are nine more moves than there are lights on the board. (There can be no triplets because each pattern is composed of distinct selections.) If these doublets are subtracted out, you arrive at the same board state in 16 or fewer moves, which is a contradiction. Ergo, there is no such thing as an efficient path of 18 moves."],"category":"solitaire","themes":[2,11],"variations":17}

(6 random and 30 fixed setups)   This is the story of Whitey, the polar bear, who lived on ice floes in the arctic. At first you see Whitey swimming in the arctic waters looking for an ice floe to climb onto. Click an ice floe with a low number to start the game. Whitey cannot not stay long on any ice floe because the floes are melting. At any move, he must jump to another of the ice floes left, the next always carrying a bigger number than the last. How long can you keep Whitey happy?   Before you start, turn on Smart Moves via View/Options/Board/SmartMoves. Click a board position to drop a Whitey to mark the starting position. From now on click numbers with increasing value (like 2,5,7,11,12....)   You can only visit a destination which carries a number bigger than the number of the previous destination. You can jump as far as you like over unvisited numbers, but they will disappear. (In some variants the jumped numbers stay). You can also jump over empty positions. You can go into any of eight directions and you can turn with every move.   Your goal is to visit as many ice floes as possible. The number of positions you have visited as well as the length of the longest known tour are shown at the right border. The border also shops the number of the ice floe the bear is on. All solutions have been found by hand, so you might be able to improve on them.   30 fixed setups: Variant  1 to  5: 16 destinations on 4x4 board. Variant  6 to 10: 25 destinations on 5x5 board. Variant 11 to 15: 36 destinations on 6x6 board. Jumped numbers stay: Variant 16 to 20: 16 destinations on 4x4 board. Variant 21 to 25: 25 destinations on 5x5 board. Variant 26 to 30: 36 destinations on 6x6 board.   There are also six randomized variants:  - 16 destinations on 4x4 board.  - 25 destinations on 5x5 board.  - 36 destinations on 6x6 board.

Technical Information: Like my Zillions game 'Flamingos', the game 'Whitey' uses two board positions on the same coordinates in order to display two superimposed images  (here number and Whitey with polar bear) at the same time and place. It might be useful for other authors to study those two games to understand how this has been achieved. The disadvantage is that during replay the polar bear is not visible. An alternative method would be to have all images of numbers copied with the polar bear on them, thereby doubling the number of pieces and images.

It is easy to code the logical gates AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOT in Wireworld. By combining such gates the workings of a computer can be simulated. The default variant shows the NOT gate, the next variant the OR gate and so on.The 'electron' gun on the left emits one electron every 12 cycles, just to demopnstrate the NOT gate. The interval between data ('electron' or 'not electron') at the output is 6 cycles. Distance between electrons for this gate to operate properly: multiples of 6 cycles.  Click button '1' ('6', '30', '00') to run one, six, thirty cycles or forever. This will show how the 'electrons' move through the 'wires'. The 'hook' sign to the right is the sign for the logical 'NOT'.  Apart from showing the famous Wireworld setup, this game 'Wireworlds' also allows you to create a whole class of automatons (all closely related to the orginal Wireworld) by clicking the 'Y' buttons at the right border. The number of Red neighbors determines whether a Yellow square turns Red,the number of Blue neighbors determines whether a Red square turns Blue,the number of Yellow neighbors determines whether a Blue square turns Yellow.  Clicking a Y-button on advances a cell's stage. E.g., the buttons in the column underneath the red square determine when Red turns to Blue. A few additional buttons are for the convenience to trigger several buttons simultaneously: Row of coloured buttons: Click a colour to reset a whole column to 'Y' or blank. Numbers of neighbors: Click to reset a whole row to 'Y' or blank.  Click the left, right, up, down buttons to shift the pattern on the board.You can click the board to edit it.

(30 variants) If a shape tiles a rectangle, then this rectangle is called a 'prime rectangle' or a 'prime' for short, if it is minimal in the sense that it cannot be cut into smaller rectangles which also can be tiled by the given shape. Hence for each shape that is 'rectifiable' (i.e. which can tile a rectangle), it is an interesting task to find all prime rectangles ('primes') for this tile. For any given tile there can only be a finite number of such rectangles. For the Y-pentomino we present here all known prime rectangles small enough to fit onto our board of size 32x32. The Y-pentomino is represented by five square tokens.The system will automatically change the colour of the tokens after you have put down 5 tokens. The system guides you through the placing of the five tokens per tile: Place two squares side by side, then a third orthogonally next to the second. The system will drop the remaining two squares automatically.  You can DELETE a placed pentomino by simply clicking the three squares which you placed on the board when you created the tile. You win if you manage to fill the given rectangle. Solutions (zsg files) for most variants are attached. Please note that there are three piece sets available.  The primes 10x16, 15x16 and 15x22 were first published by C.J. Bouwkamp and D.A. Klarner in JRM(3(1), which used a computer.The 15x15 prime was found by Jennifer Hazelgrove with a computer (see JRM 7(3)). All other primes were found by hand (!) by the author (9x20, 9x30, 10x14, 11x20, 14x15, 17x30, 21x25, 25x27), see Journal of Recreational Mathematics Vol 12(3), 1979-80. Astonishingly, my results found by hand bettered some of the earlier results found by computer. Some of my results on prime rectangles (10x23, 11x30, 17x30, 18x25, 21x25) are published with this Zillions game for the first time.

Players win by connecting their edges of the board with a chain of their marbles. Marbles are connected if they touch orthogonally (squarely) or one rests directly upon the other.  If a chain crosses over another chain then the uppermost chain prevails; the lower chain is cut until the upper connection is removed (over/under rule).  Each turn the current player must either:(1) Drop one of their marbles onto an empty board hole, or;(2) Pick up one of their marbles and move it to a connected valid empty point. The marble cannot have more than one marble resting directly upon it from the level above.  An empty point is valid if it is either a board hole, or a flat stable square formed by four adjacent supporting marbles on the level below. A point is connected if a path can be traced from it back to the piece being moved, by stepping through adjacent pieces of the same colour. At least one other piece must be involved in the connected path.  Moving a marble may cause higher marbles to drop. Any dropping marbles are removed from the connectivity and support calculations for that move. That is, any marble whichs drops cannot be used as a support piece for that move, nor can it be used as part of the path connecting any destination point.

One player has four black","stones, the other has four white stones.","The initial configuration of the board is: xxxx___oooo. 'X' stands for a black stone, 'O' - for a white one. Blacks always have the first move.","The players take turns moving.  At each turn, each player can move","only one piece, once. A player cannot pass up on his turn. A player","can move any one of his pieces to the next unoccupied slot to its right","or left, which may involve jumping over occupied slots. A player cannot","move a piece off the side of the board.","If a move creates a pattern where the opponent's pieces are","surrounded, on both sides, by two pieces of the mover's color (with no","intervening unoccupied blank slot), then those surrounded pieces are","removed from the board.","The goal of the game is to remove all of your opponent's pieces, at","which point the game ends.  Removing all-but-one ends the game as","well, since the opponent can't surround you with one piece, and so will","always lose within a few moves anyway."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":0}

A Pod can orbit around a pivot through any number of empty spaces or through outer space (off the board) provided it comes to rest on an empty space on the board.  It must land in a space adjacent to the pivot in the forward direction.  A Pod cannot capture.","When a Pod reaches the shaded area on the far side of the board, it promotes to a War Pod.  A War Pod moves like a regular Pod, with the exception that it can land on any orbital space (i.e., forward progress is not required), and it captures any enemy piece that it orbits around.","When a War Pod returns to the shaded area on its own side of the board, it promotes to a Death Pod.  A Death Pod moves like a War Pod, with the added condition that it captures any enemy piece that it lands next to.","Because pieces must have pivots to move, an isolated piece is frozen. The game is won by scattering the enemy fleet and leaving it with no move.  A player who has no pieces or no moves at the start of a turn loses.","Two training variants are included.  In the first, the object is to promote a Pod into a War Pod.

This phase is characterized by the tactics of stalemate and zugzwang.  In the second training variant, the object is to promote a War Pod into a Death Pod.  This variant adds the \"battle\" phase to the \"civilian\" phase and focuses attention on gaining the edge in battle through construction of an ultimate weapon.","Both of the training variants are virtually draw-proof.

Arimaa was designed to be difficult for computers to play, yet easy for people to learn and play.   A challenge of $10,000 USD is offered to the  first person or company that can build a computer program which can defeat the best Arimaa player  prior to 2020.   Objective The first player to get just one Rabbit across the board to the other side wins. If both players lose all their Rabbits the game is a draw.   Setup The game has no fixed starting position for the pieces.  The game starts with an empty board.  First Gold sets down all the pieces in any order on  the first 2 rows.  Silver can then set down all the pieces on the first 2 rows closest to Silvers side.  Once the peices have been set down the players take turn moving the pieces with Gold going first. Each player has 8 Rabbits, 2 Cats, 2 Dogs, 2 Horses, 1 Camel and 1 Elephant.   Steps In each turn the players can take up to 4 steps. All pieces move the same way, which is laterally (i.e. left, right, forward and back). Except that Rabbits cannot move  backwards.  Moving a piece from its current square to an adjacent square counts  as one step.  The 4 steps can be distributed across multiple pieces.  Thus a player  can move one piece 4 steps, four pieces 1 step each,one piece 3 steps and another  piece 1 step,  etc. The same piece may take steps in different directions. At least  1 step must be taken on each turn to change the state of the board.   Pushing and Pulling A piece can push opponents weaker pieces to any laterally adjacent square and  move into its place. This is called 'pushing' and uses up 2 steps; one for  pushing the opponents piece and one for moving into its square. Pushing must  be completed within a players turn and cannot be distributed across turns.  The Elephant is the strongest and can push any other piece except another Elephant. The Elephant is followed in strength by the Camel, then the Horse, Dog, Cat and finally the Rabbit which is the weakest and cannot push any other piece.  Pieces of equal strength cannot push each other. A piece can also pull opponents weaker pieces which are laterally adjacent into the square that it moved from.  This is called 'pulling' and uses up 2 steps; one for moving the piece and one for pulling the opponents piece. A piece cannot pull while completing a push.   Freezing A piece that is alone and laterally adjacent to an opponents stronger piece is  considered 'frozen' and cannot move. A piece is considered to be alone if there is no friendly pieces laterally adjacent to it. The lonely weaker piece  can be 'unfrozen' by moving any other friendly piece next to it. When no longer  alone the weaker piece is unfrozen and can immediately begin to move within  the same turn.   Traps The squares c3, f3, c6 and f6 are called 'traps'. Any piece that is standing  on a trap square is immeadiatly removed from the board if there are no friendly piece laterally adjacent to it. A piece may safely stand on or pass through a trap square as long as there is a friendly piece adjacent to it. If the friendly piece moves away then the lonely  piece on the trap square is immeadiately removed from the board.

It bears some resemblance to Halma. In England this game is also called Officers and Sepoys after the Indian revolt in 1857-58 when Indian troops (Sepoys) revolted against their British officers. The Soldiers should be prepared to sacrifice themselves in order to divert the Officers from the defence of the fortress. It is a challenging task for the Soldiers player. The Officers make the first move.","In the classic version the pieces are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. This pattern restricts piece movement and occurs on Asalto boards from the 18th century. The object of the attacking Soldiers is to occupy the Fortress (the lower nine holes) or to surround the two defending Officers so they can't move. Unlike the Officers the Soldiers cannot move backwards. The object of the Officers is to capture enough Soldiers so they can't occupy all nine positions in the fortress.","The Officer moves to any empty, adjacent hole. If an adjacent hole is occupied by a Soldier and the hole directly behind is vacant, then the Officer must jump over it and capture it, as in checkers. Several Soldiers may be captured like this in a single turn. The Soldier steps diagonally and orthogonally down, left, or right. It can't capture. Remember that you can add or remove Soldiers from the initial position so that it reflects your playing strength.","In the German version the Soldier steps straight down or diagonally down. It may only move left or right at the lowest side of the arms (otherwise it would be stuck there). This variant seems the most difficult for the Soldiers.","I have also invented a modern version (if it's not already invented) which does not utilize the Alquerque board pattern and where diagonal movement for the Officers is thus unrestricted. In this version the Soldier side has even more pieces. Soldiers move only orthogonally and not backwards. It is played on a solitaire board.","Remember that you can add or remove Soldiers from the initial position so that it reflects your playing strength."],"category":"other","themes":[5,12,37],"variations":6}

The object is to build an Atom, similar to one of the three starting patterns, inside the Core. The Core is the yellow area at the center of the playing field.  Play begins with removal of the Control Rods from the Core and their placement on empty spaces of the playing field. Spaces which are not adjacent to another Control Rod nor the edge of the playing field. Each player picks up and places one Control Rod per turn until all the Control Rods have been placed. Once a Control Rod is placed on the playing field, it cannot be moved the remainder of the game.  Each of the Atoms are made up of three types of particles, four Electrons, two Protons and one Neutron. Each particle can be moved according to the following rules:  ELECTRONS and PROTONSThese two particles may move by orbiting and free-flight.Orbiting consists of moving around, through empty spaces, an adjacent particle or Control Rod.An Electron and Proton may orbit any one particle or Control Rod. Free-flight is accomplished by an Electron or Proton when it is only adjacent to particles of its kind. When that adjacent particle is behind and an empty space is in front, the Electron or Proton may fly in a straight line until it strikes another particle, a Control Rod or the edge of the playing field.  If an Electron strikes a Proton, the Proton becomes a Neutron.If a Proton strikes an Electron, the Electron becomes a Neutron.If an Electron strikes a Neutron, the Neutron becomes n Electron.If a Proton strikes a Neutron, the Neutron becomes a Proton.If an Electron strikes an Electron, or a Proton strikes a Proton, it preforms a deflecting bounce.If an Electron or Proton strikes the edge of the playing field, they preform a reflecting bounce.If an Electron or Proton strikes a Control Rod, it stops movement.  A deflecting bounce consists of a change in direction of travel, either right-forward or left-forward.A reflecting bounce consists of a change in direction of travel, either right-forward, left-forward, right-backward or left-backward. Only one bounce, either deflecting or reflecting, is permitted per turn. If the bounce would result in a possible second bounce, the first bounce cannot be preformed.At the end of the bounce, either reflecting or deflecting, all strike conditions must be observed.  NEUTRONSNeutron can only orbit. They cannot orbit other Neutrons or Control Rods.  A player may move any particle on the playing field, after all Control Rod placements, under the following restrictions:","A player may not move any particle, or its surrounding particles, which the opponent last moved.","Particles in the Core cannot be moved. A player can lose the game, if at the end of the turn there is only one Proton or Electron left. Or the outer rim of the Core is filled and there is no Neutron in its center.

The English version presented here, which is now standard,  dates from the mid-seventeenth century.","For the precise rules, please read the \"description\" section that  comes with the game.  A discussion of scoring is included under  the \"history\" section.","In general, the players roll the dice and move their pieces around  the board (counterclockwise for Light, clockwise for Dark) the number  of points shown on the dice.  If a doublet is roled the player gets  four moves.  A piece cannot land on a point occupied by two or more  enemy pieces.  If a piece lands on a point occupied by a single enemy  piece, that enemy piece is moved to the vertical bar in the middle of  the bar.  A piece on the bar must be moved back into play before any  other moves can be made.  A player wins by moving all 15 pieces into  the home on the right side of the board.  The home cannot be entered  until all of the player's pieces are in the inner board (the six  points next to the home).  An exact role is required to move a piece  home, unless no other pieces are further out.","Also included in this package are the popular Backgammon variants  Nackgammon, Hypergammon, and Deadgammon.  Nackgammon and Hypergammon  follow Backgammon rules but have different opening arrays.

The rules are simple:Win by moving a piece to the opposite side.Pieces move forward or diagonally forward and capture diagonally forward. Because the pieces have no choice but to move forward, the game develops quickly. Draws are impossible. The game is similar to a pawn promotion battle, except that the pieces move diagonally forward even when not capturing. This diagonal motion allows you to 'skirt' by an opponent piece by facing it head on, where it cannot capture you, and then moving diagonally around it.As a result, a single piece cannot by itself prevent an opponent piece from 'breaking through' the ranks. When pieces are spaced out along diagonals, an opponent piece can easily skirt through them. Look for weak links in your opponent's defenses where a single piece to the rear is guarding two attack routes.

Parker, founder of Parker Brothers, it was originally marketed under the name Chivalry. The game achieved a substantial following after its re-release in 1930, with minor rule changes, under the name Camelot. Its players included chess champion Jose Raoul Capablanca, also known as the inventor of Capablanca Chess. In recent years the World Camelot Federation has rekindled interest in the game.

A Soldier moves one step in all directions. It can also jump forwards and sideways over any piece except a Castle. Jumps in the three backwards directions only occur when making a capture. In its first move, the Soldier may go two steps.","A Soldier captures an enemy Soldier by jumping over it. Soldiers can capture a Castle by surrounding it on three sides orthogonally. A Soldier may continue jumping as long as possible, but it cannot jump back immediately from where it came. If you want to stop jumping prematurely, press \"Pass Move\". The four nearest Castles are friendly and cannot be captured. The middle Castles are neutral and can be captured by both players. But the central Castle cannot be captured before one of the Castles on the enemy side has been captured. This game is remarkably similar to a medieval battle situation. If you want to set up a position, please use the alternative variant, as this ensures functionality.","Castello was designed by Carl Renström. It was first published by BRIO in 1965. BRIO was founded in 1884 in Osby, a small town located in southern Sweden. Today, the small family-run business has grown into the global company BRIO AB, with subsidiaries in Germany, France and Japan and distributors around the world. BRIO's product portfolio currently consists of numerous toys but also games for the whole family under the brand Alga. BRIO has been a Purveyor to the Royal Court of Sweden since the 1940s. Today, BRIO is owned by Ravensburger.","Discussion","In the original rules, the Soldier can both step and jump in the eight directions. But eight freedoms for continuous jump moves seems excessive. That's probably why the original rules include a rule that prevents capture of more than five pieces during one jump sequence. But this restriction is no longer necessary, as jump freedoms in this implementation have been reduced to five, except during capture. (Capture in the three backward directions is still allowed.) The Soldier can still step in eight directions.","Reference","An image of the Castello rules sheet (Swedish) can be found here: http://mlwi.magix.net/bg/castello.htm","A thanks to P.

Only twelve showed up.  To reward his guests, the Jade Emperor announced that     he would name a year of the Zodiac after each.  The animals were all duly honored.  But then the question of order arose.      The Ox, the most brawny of all the animals but also the most dull-witted, insisted he should be first due to his tremendous strength.     The Rat, puniest of all the animals but also the most cunning, argued he should be first due to his keen intelligence.  The other animals,    who possessed both strength and intelligence in varying degrees, soon joined the quarrel.  Some sided with the Ox, saying that strength was    more important than intelligence.  Others sided with the Rat, saying intelligence was more important than strength.  While still others wavered    back and forth.  So to settle the matter, the Rat proposed a contest.","This game uses the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac.  Each animal possesses    its own unique combination of strength and intelligence.  During the first phase, strength is crucial; in the second phase, intelligence is valued.","The    board starts off empty.  The players alternately place their pieces on their sides of the board.  Each piece must be placed on the unoccupied  yellow spaces    within their first three rows.  The direction a piece is facing indicates which player it belongs to.  After each player has placed all their twelve pieces,    the game can begin.  North, for having gone second during the set-up stage, gets to move first.","An animal can not capture an animal stronger than itself.     The animals are ranked in strength, from strongest to weakest:  12. Ox, 11. Tiger, 10. Dragon, 9. Horse, 8. Dog, 7. Goat, 6. Pig, 5. Snake, 4. Rooster, 3. Monkey, 2. Hare, 1. Rat.","When an animal reaches the far rank, it is removed to the side and scored according to its intelligence.  The animals are ranked in intelligence, from smartest to dumbest:  12. Rat,    11. Hare, 10 Monkey, 9. Rooster, 8. Snake, 7. Pig, 6. Goat, 5. Dog, 4. Horse, 3. Dragon, 2. Tiger, 1. Ox.  As can be seen, an animal's intelligence is in inverse proportion to its strength.     In other words, the weaker the animal the more valuable it is and vice-versa.","Other than this, normal Checkers rules apply.  Pieces can only move diagonally forward, either by sliding    to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side.  Jumping over a piece captures it.   Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping    and capturing as long as it is possible.","When one player is unable to make a move, by either having no more pieces left on the Checkerboard, or by having all his pieces blocked from movement,    the game ends and the player with the higher score wins.

The game ends","when no further moves can be made, meaning the rules have stabilized, and","all rules have been enforced. In the end the winner (if any) is the player","with the most stones on the board.","The two players are called X and Y, after the horizontal and vertical axes.","How the current rules affect a given square is determined by","how many X and Y stones surround the square in the eight directions: if the","number of player-X neighbors is x, and the number of player-Y neighbors is y, look at the","given square's 'rule square' at position (x,y) on the board, viewed as a table.","Viewed as a 'rule', an X stone at position (x,y) proclaims: 'Any square with","x player-X neighbors and y player-Y neighbors shall have an X stone'. Analogously if the (x,y)","square has a Y stone, or is empty. A player's move enforces one such 'rule'.","In the main variant, small dots and holes are used to indicate the possible","moves, giving four types of pieces:","Potential (small dot): this square is 'really' empty, but there is a stone","on the 'rule square', so the owner of the this Potential can change this to","a Stable stone.","Stable (solid stone): this stone is supported by a friendly stone on the","'rule square', so this Stable stone cannot be taken or flipped.","Unstable (stone with hole): this stone's 'rule square' is empty, so this","Unstable stone can be taken by the enemy player.","Reversible (stone with center of opposite color): this stone's 'rule square'","has a stone of opposite color, so the enemy player can flip this to a Stable","stone of the enemy color.","All the indicators are automatically updated on each move. Note that Potentials","don't count as stones; they represent empty squares where stones can be added.","Players cannot take or flip their own pieces; they must pass when they have no","legal moves.

Conversely, you can try to create patterns that","correspond to the rules of squares you already control. For example, in the","early stages, there are few pieces on the board, so the squares on the lower","left tend to be the most important, but as the board fills up, the emphasis","moves gradually outward.

In recent years the World Camelot Federation has rekindled interest in the game. To learn more about the history of Chivalry, and to join the Federation, visit the Federation's web site at http://groups.msn.com/worldcamelotfederation/homepage.","Chivalry is played on a 14x16 board, with six squares removed from each of the corners to give the board an oval shape. To see a notation key, select \"Switch Piece Set\" from the View menu. Two spaces protrude from both the top and bottom of the board. These are called the \"castles.\" The object of the game is to occupy the enemy castle by moving two of your pieces into it. You also win by capturing all opponent pieces, provided you have at least two pieces remaining. A draw is declared if both players are reduced to a single piece. Stalemate is a loss.","Each player starts the game with 20 pieces, consisting of twelve Men and eight Knights. A Man has three basic moves. It may move one space in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal. This is called a \"plain\" move. It may jump over a friendly adjacent piece and continue jumping, at its option, as long as friendly pieces remain to be jumped. This move is called \"cantering.\" And it may jump over an enemy piece, thereby capturing it, in which case it must continue jumping as long as captures are available. A Man may not canter and capture in the same move.","The Knight has all the moves of the Man plus one important addition, called the Knight's \"charge.\" A charge consists of a cantering move (or series) followed by capturing. Once a Knight makes a capture, it must continue making captures if available and may not return to cantering.","Circular canters, i.e., canters that return to an already visited square, are not permitted. Visited squares are indicated by flags. The flags are cleared at the end of the cantering sequence.

A player is not required to make a Knight's charge, with the exception that when a capture is directly available, the player may satisfy the compulsory capture rule through a Knight's charge. When cantering a Knight must make a capture if one becomes directly available but may do so through a charge.","Special rules govern the castle. Once a piece enters the enemy castle, it may never leave. A piece in the enemy castle is permitted to move laterally twice during the game. You may never enter your own castle except through a capture, in which case the piece must be moved out as soon as possible. If the piece cannot move out through another capture on the same turn, then it must be moved out on the next turn (even if this means declining a capture elsewhere on the board).

The winning formation may be a \"chain\" or a \"cluster\" of pieces, but all pieces of the same color must be at the \"correct\" height of 2 and connected to each other.","The gameboard is comprised of holes of two different depths, some of which are shallow (no bevel) and some of which are deep (with bevel).","Each player has an equal number of pieces.  Half of each player's pieces are short, the other half are tall. The number on the top of the piece represents the absolute height of the piece which depends on both the length of the piece and the depth of hole that it currently resides in. Specifically: Height 3 - Tall peg in shallow hole. Height 2 - Tall peg in deep hole - or - Short peg in shallow hole. Height 1 - Short peg in deep hole.","At the beginning of the game, each player's tall pieces are in the shallow holes (height 3) whereas the short pieces are in the deep holes (height 1).","The movement of the pieces is as follows: JUMP move - A player may jump with any one of their pieces, regardless of location, any number of pieces, regardless of color or height, along a straight line and landing in the first vacant hole in the direction of the jump.- or -STEP move - A player may move one of their pieces one space into any adjoining vacant hole.","Clarifications:","A player may never jump over an empty hole (the piece must land in the first vacant hole along the line of the jump). So if there are four pieces of varying color and heights in a line, all four pieces can be jumped over, but the moving piece must land in the first vacant hole.  If there are no vacant holes along the line of the desired jump, then a jump cannot occur in that direction.  Short pieces can jump tall pieces and vice versa.","A piece may jump laterally (sideways from side to side) or diagonally along any line which is at 60 degrees to the ends of the board. So there are only two kinds of directions in which a piece may jump; sideways (back and forth) AND diagonally (back and forth). After making a single jump, the player's turn is concluded.","If a piece is isolated at the end of the board with several empty spaces between another piece on the board, that piece may only move one space per turn in order to join up with the other pieces or before it can jump multiple pieces in a single jump.","Note: the difference in length between a tall piece and a short piece is the same as the difference in the depth between a shallow hole and a deep hole, so when a short piece is in a shallow hole and a tall piece is in an adjoining deep hole, the two pieces will have the same absolute height above the game board.","Variants: The variants include both the large 64 hole board (with 2 setups) and the smaller 46 hole board. The diamond pattern variants are not playable, they are simply nice patterns.  For a physical game, the pieces can be arranged this way for storage.","For additional information on Cluster, including a stand-alone Axiom version of this game,","see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22004"],"category":"other","themes":[36,12,39],"variations":5}

Troyka","created":"2001-09-08","description":["Congklak is a Mancala game played in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Phillipines. It is known by a variety of regional names, including Sungka and Dakon. The game is essentially a hybrid of Kalah and Endodoi, also available on Zillions. It employs the capturing method of Kalah with the multi-lap sowing of Endodoi.  Congklak was featured on the cover page of the second edition of Abstract Games Magazine. Unlike Kalah, Congklak is an indigenous game with a long history of local play. As explained in more detail in the \"History\" section to Kalah, the game Kalah was likely derived from Congklak by an American game enthusiast in the early 20th century.  Congklak is traditionally played on 2x5 and 2x7 boards with cowrie shells or similar counters. This version is played with rubies. (You must pre-apply with our credit department before playing.) The number of rubies in each hole at the start of a game corresponds to the number of holes on each side of the board. Unlike most Mancala games, sowing takes place in the clockwise direction. Rubies are sown into a player's store -- but not the enemy store -- and into the lift hole on subsequent laps.  A turn consists of sowing the rubies from a hole on the player's side of the board. In the 2x7 version (the default), if the last ruby is dropped in the store, the player gets another turn starting from any friendly occupied hole. If the last ruby is dropped in an occupied hole, the rubies in that hole, including the last ruby dropped, are picked up and a new sowing begins as part of the same turn. You can make up to twenty moves in a single turn in this implementation. If the last ruby drops in an empty hole on the player's side of the board, any rubies in the enemy hole directly opposite are captured along with the last ruby dropped, and the turn ends. If the last ruby drops in an empty enemy hole or in an empty friendly hole opposite an empty enemy hole, the turn ends without any captures.  In the 2x5 version, if the last ruby from a sowing lands in the player's store, the turn ends without further moves. I have adopted this rule from the Abstract Games Magazine article. Although most descriptions of Congklak provide that sowing into the store gives you an extra turn, in the 2x5 version the bottom player can win the game on the first turn -- without the top player ever making a move! -- if such moves are permitted.  For the complete rule set, please read the \"Game Description\" that comes with the game.  Please send any comments or bug reports to dtroyka@justice.com.

This rule is designed to make the game less drawish.

Accordingly, there are variants with and without promotion, with promotion being the default. Also, Pritchard says nothing about any requirement for a capturing sequence to capture the maximum number of pieces.  Variants with and without are also supplied, but the default game is without since there seems to be no reason to assume that there was such a rule."],"image":"game297_scr_Damate.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":5}

Draws may occur by mutual impotence or three-fold repetition of moves.  A \"line of men\" means a straight unbroken orthogonal or diagonal line of men of the same color. A man or a line of men moves one square forward, either orthogonally or diagonally. A man ending its move on the opponent's back rank promotes to king. Kings move like Chess queens, any number of unobstructed squares orthogonally or diagonally.  Although pieces may move diagonally, all captures follow horizontal and vertical (i.e. orthogonal) lines only. Men may capture forwards, backwards and sideways by the short leap. Kings may move queenwise, but they capture only rookwise, by the long leap. Capturing, whether by men or kings, is compulsory. Multiple captures may be made in the same turn. The captured pieces are only removed at the end of the turn, and it is not allowed to jump over the same piece twice in that turn, although vacant squares may be passed over more than once. Majority capture takes precedence: if a player has a choice of capturing options, he must choose the option that results in the largest number of pieces being captured (kings and men counting equally).   Croda Included as a variant, even though the game precedes Dameo, is Croda, a draughts game invented in 1995 by Ljuban Dedic of Croatia, 1989 Checkers champion of former Yugoslavia. Croda actually was the inspiration to invent Dameo. Many things are equal between the two - apart from an other initial position, there are only some differences in movement. In Croda, there's no linear movement - a man only moves on his own. And a king moves as a rook in chess: any number of unobstructed squares orthogonally. All the other rules of Dameo equally apply to Croda.","Dameo is just one of the games invented by Christian Freeling; they can all be seen, and some of them played, on the internet in the MindSports ArenA."],"image":"game298_scr_Dameo.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":2}

While the pattern restricts piece movement one can introduce orthogonal movement without making the game too complicated. The idea is to propose a less forced form of Checkers. Pieces move forward, either straight or diagonally. They may capture (jump) only diagonally forwards (like in Checkers). Goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces. Pieces are promoted to kings at the last rank. Kings move and capture in all directions. Capture is obligatory. Stalemate is a loss.","As a variant is included another invention of mine, Damtafl, which is inspired from the Viking game Halatafl.

Poles of the same color repel each other. So they are not allowed to lie side to side. Furthermore, the board has an underlying \"outer field\", indicated by lightly red and lightly blue squares. Red poles may only be dropped on lightly red squares, and blue poles only on lightly blue squares. In the beginning of a game the outer field is generated randomly by pressing the start button or clicking any square.  Dip drops a vertical dipole by clicking the lower part of the destination. Ole drops a horizontal dipole by clicking the left part of the destination. For human players it helps a lot to activate the feature that shows all legal moves, especially in play against Zillions.  Dipole contains some elements of the more traditional games CrossCram (=Domineering) and British Square. In Zillions, Dipole comes in three variants for board sizes 8x8, 10x10, and 13x13.

Likewise, there are two sets of twelve pieces -- one of each colour.","SETTING UP -- Choose any random method to decide who plays which colour.  Players then face each other with the board placed lengthways between them and so oriented that they each have the broad border line of their own colour at their near end.  At start of play, both players arrange their pieces on their three near rows, using the playing points that match the colour they are playing.  Throughout the game, pieces stay on their own colour and always move by following lines of that colour.","THE OBJECT OF THE GAME for each player is to be the first to have four pieces planted on the opposing player's first row (in other words, their own far row).  This wins even if the other player could match it or take one of the pieces on their next move.","MOVES -- The player with red starts and thereafter each player in turn moves a piece along a line of their own colour to the nearest playing point of that colour.  On your turn of play you may only move one piece and only one piece may occupy a playing point at any moment.  As long as a player is able to move, he or she must do so.  Except when making a capture (see next section), pieces can only move forwards:  either directly or diagonally.  Note that any orthogonal move (i.e., not a diagonal one) bypasses an enemy playing point.  Such a move can only be made if the intervening point is unoccupied.  This rule applies to capturing moves also.","CAPTURES are by custodianship, or \"sandwiching.\"  When a move is made which results in an enemy piece being sandwiched -- either vertically or horizontally -- then the sandwiched piece is removed from the board.  Often two (and sometimes three) pieces can be captured in one go.  Four is possible but unlikely.  Capturing is optional rather than compulsory.  Unlike other moves, capturing moves can be made in any direction.  A piece can be moved to a point between two enemy pieces (i.e., into a sandwich) without being captured.  A piece that does so, however, can often be taken immediately afterwards by a move which completes an alternatively oriented sandwich on it.  When a piece moves into a sandwich, it can still effect a capture in the normal way.","RULES CONCERNING PIECES ON THE FAR ROW -- When a piece has reached the far row it may not be moved again except to capture.  If it moves sideways to do so, it stays at the point moved to -- unless it makes another capturing move later.  However, if a piece moves back off the far row in order to capture, then the restriction against non-capturing moves ceases.  Pieces on the far row have no protection against being taken although it is worth noting that it is not possible to capture a piece on a corner point.  Of course, once a winning occupation of the far row has been completed, no piece can be taken and the game ends.","FURTHER POINTS ABOUT HOW THE GAME MAY END -- A player would normally give up when he or she is reduced to three pieces, cannot move, or has pieces so badly placed that a winning occupation of the far row cannot be achieved.  In all such cases, however, the game can also be played out to the finish if the defending player wishes.  Whenever one player is unable to move, the other simply continues with successive moves, which may continue until the game is concluded.  In the rare event of neither player being able to get four pieces to their far row, the result is a draw.","Please send any comments or bug reports to  dtroyka@justice.com."],"image":"game319_scr_DoubleTake.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":0}

So it cannot capture backwards as immediate move.","Discussion","Most Western checkers variants belong to either of two groups, International/Polish or Spanish. In the former, a Man may capture backwards; in the latter only forwards. The problem with backwards capture is that the defence becomes easy. Although a Man advances, it retains control of squares in the rear. The problem with the Spanish group is that it has less combinatorial complexity, due to less capture directions.","Draughts with Deferred Backwards Capture keeps the advantages of both. Although A Man can also capture backwards, it may only do this later, as part of a series. It means that the defence becomes more difficult. A Man may sneak behind the back of an enemy Man and reach a promotion square. This vouches for a less drawish game. Moreover, the advanced and interesting combinatorial aspects of International/Polish variants are retained. Arguably, the introduction of the deferred backwards capture rule is a significant improvement. Worse endgames will become more difficult to hold. Although this variant is an invention of undersigned, the rule already exists in a traditional Gothic (orthogonal) checkers variant (\"Armenian checkers II\"), where a Man may not capture southwards as immediate move. However, here the strategical impact of the rule is less pronounced.","Proposed variants","The following variants have been implemented. The deferred backwards capture rule is combined with any of the following. In International Draughts, three Kings against one King is seldom a win, which tends to make the game drawish in grandmaster practice. Diverse halt rules have been proposed as a remedy. I introduce a new one, below.","Killer rule (Freeling, C.) When a King occurs as final capture, the captor must halt behind the enemy piece. Thus, two Kings will win against a lone King. (Arguably, this means an overly radical departure from the standard rules. After all, one should be able to play confidently for a draw with one Man less.)","Sequential killer rule (\"Killer light\") (Anikejev, J.) When a King occurs as the final capture of a series, the captor must halt behind the enemy piece. Thus, three Kings will win against a lone King. This variant (deferred backwards capture + killer light) would definitely solve the draw problem.","Sequential halt rule (Damme, A.K.W.) When any piece occurs as the final capture of a series, the captor must halt behind the enemy piece. Thus, three Kings will win against a lone King. (Arguably, this reduces the power of the King too much during the middlegame.)","Sequential halt rule II (\"Killer extra-light\") (Winther, M.) When two Kings occur as the final captures of a series, the captor must halt behind the enemy piece. Thus, three Kings will win against a lone King. This variant (deferred backwards capture + sequential halt rule II) would definitely solve the draw problem. With this rule, middlegame play is hardly affected at all.","Piece movement","A Man steps diagonally forwards. It captures, by the short leap, in all diagonal directions. A King slides and captures in all diagonal directions over any distance. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A King may \"fly\" over empty squares (\"long King\").","A Man promotes to King at the last rank. If a Man makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square and can continue capturing, it does not promote. One must continue capturing as long as possible. It is mandatory to select the longest capturing line. Captured pieces are removed only after the move is finished. The goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces.","The game is played on an 10x10 board with 20 pieces per player.

For a hexagonal variant see HexEmergo.Emergo has a better balance between strategic and tactical aspects than HexEmergo, hence Zillions is weaker at it.  Like checkers type games and Bushka, column checkers is about a simple two-men-three-squares scenario: put a black and a white man on adjacent squares. Now the white man can jump the black man, landing on the third (vacant) square and removing the jumped man from play. That's checkers type capture. Alternatively, the white man can jump the black man and taking it along underneath as a prisoner, landing on the third square. That's column checkers capture.  Now with a little imagination, one can see a man capturing several men as prisoners in a multiple capture. Next imagine this piece itself is jumped by the opponent: the guard is captured and the prisoners are now released! This released column can now in turn start to make prisoners and these will buried under several guards - to release them, the piece must be jumped a corresponding number of times!That's the general idea, and the most significant difference with checkers type capture is that no pieces ever leave the board! Obviously a win is achieved by capturing all the opponent's men.  A complete and illustrated explanation of the rules is included in the download.   Emergo derives from the Latin 'Luctor et Emergo', the motto of the Dutch province of Zeeland, and meaning 'I wrestle and emerge'. You'll find this name to be very appropriate.Emergo originates in the game Laska, invented by the legendary world champion Chess Emanuel Lasker.  Emergo is just one of the games invented by Christian Freeling; they can all be seen, and some of them played, on the internet in the MindSports ArenA.  (Hexagonal) Emergo is featured in R.

Multi-lap games are distinguished by the rule that when a sowing ends in an occupied hole on either side of the board, the beans in that hole are picked up and a new sowing begins as part of the same turn. This process continues until the sowing ends in an empty hole. You can make up to twenty moves in a turn this way in this implementation.  Capturing in Endodoi is the same as in Kalah. When the sowing ends in an empty hole on the player's side of the board, any enemy beans in the hole directly opposite are captured and placed in the store. Sowing in Endodoi is counterclockwise. Beans are sowed into the lift hole on subsequent laps. Beans are not sowed into the store.  The complete rules of Endodoi can be found in the \"Game Description\" section that comes with the game.  In the variants, the players start with three, four, five, or six beans in each hole. A player wins by capturing more than half of all available beans.

Troyka","inventorIDs":[146],"inventor":"Robert Abbott","created":"2002-02-16","notes":"1975","description":["Crossings (c) 1969 Robert Abbott.","Epaminondas, invented by Robert Abbott, is often described as a modern classic.  The game is named after a Theban general credited with innovations to the phalanx which led to the Theban victory over Sparta in 371 B.C.  Epaminondas was originally published in 1969 under the name Crossings in Sid Sackson's A Gamut of Games.  In 1975 Abbott released a revised version of the game, now called Epaminondas, played on a larger board and with a modified capturing rule.  The original Crossings is included as a variant in this package.  Both Epaminondas and Crossings are described in Wayne Schmittberger's New Rules for Classic Games (1992).  Epaminondas was featured in the third issue of Abstract Games Magazine (Autumn 2000) and favorably reviewed in David Parlett's Oxford History of Boardgames (1999). The game is profiled at Joao Pedro Neto's World of Abstract Games website at  www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv  and is available for play at Richard's play-by-email  server at www.gamerz.net/pbmserv.   To learn more about the game, and to check  out Robert Abbott's collection of mazes, puzzles, and games, visit his website  at www.logicmazes.com.","Epaminondas is played on a 14x12 board.  Each player begins with 28 pieces  occupying two rows on opposite sides of the board.  Motion in the game is  performed by phalanx.  A phalanx in the game consists of a line of adjacent  pieces (diagonal or orthogonal).  A single piece can be considered a  phalanx of one.  A phalanx moves along the line on which it is situated,  forward or backward, any number of spaces up unto the number of pieces  contained in the phalanx.  For example, four adjacent friendly pieces on a  common diagonal can move from one to four spaces, as a group, along the  diagonal in either direction.  Spaces moved through must be empty and the  lead piece in the phalanx must come to rest on an empty space or a space  occupied by an enemy.  In the latter case, the enemy piece and all enemy  pieces forming a phalanx behind it in the direction of motion will be  captured, but only if the moving phalanx is longer than the attacked  phalanx.  If the moving phalanx is shorter than or equal in length to the  attacked phalanx, the move cannot be made.","A part of a phalanx can be moved provided the part is itself a phalanx.   For example, if there are five adjacent friendly pieces in a row, two  pieces at one end can move forward one or two spaces as a phalanx of two,  or three pieces can move forward up to three spaces, and so on.  Pieces can  be part of multiple phalanxes.  A single piece moves like a King in chess,  one step to any adjacent empty square, but it can never capture.","The object of the game is to move a piece onto the far row (row 12 for  White, row 1 for Black).  When a player moves a piece onto the far row, the  opponent is given a grace move to equalize the situation by capturing the  piece just moved or by moving a piece itself onto its far row.  A win is  declared when a player has a piece on the far row (or one more piece than  the opponent has on its far row) and the opponent has completed the grace  move without equalizing the situation.  Repetition is a loss.","The Epaminondas 8x8 variant is, naturally, played on an 8x8 board.  The  game Crossings follows the original 1969 rules contained in A Gamut of  Games.  These rules are the same as for Epaminondas except that the board  is 8x8, a moving phalanx captures only the first enemy piece in the  attacked phalanx, and a piece that reaches the far row is frozen and can  neither move nor be captured.","Please send any comments or bug reports to  dtroyka@justice.com."],"category":"other","themes":[5,12,23],"variations":3}

The nine spaces at the edge of the board  farthest from where a player's pieces begin is that player's goal area.","Object: There are three ways to win:     Be the first player to move your General into the goal area.    Capture the opposing General.    Have all nine spaces of the goal area (toward which you are heading)        occupied at the end of your turn -- regardless of whose pieces are        on the goal spaces.  Movement: On each turn, the player may either move a piece or bring a Reserve onto  the board. All pieces move the same way: in a straight line, in any of the six  directions, to any unoccupied space. A piece may not jump over other pieces. A Reserve may be placed on any unoccupied space on the board.","Captures: Guards are captured by becoming \"sandwiched\" between two enemy pieces on  opposite sides. A Guard may safely move between two opposing pieces without being captured.  For a capture to occur, the capturing player must be the one who makes the move. A Reserve does not make a capture on the turn it is brought onto the board,  even if it causes an opposing Guard to be sandwiched. A General can only be captured if it is surrounded by enemy pieces on all  available sides (i.e. six sides if the General is somewhere in the middle of  the board, four sides if it's on an edge, or three if it's in a corner)."],"image":"game360_scr_Escapade.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":0}

It is allowed, however, to split the stack in accordance with the move distance. E.g. if the piece to move is a stack of 3 and you want to move 2 squares, the top 2 stones will be taken to the destination cell and 1 stone will remain on the old position.   A stack may land on top of another stack, friend or foe, creating a larger stack (the sum of both). All stones in the resulting stack are then owned by the moving player.   The capacity of a board position is defined as the total number of horizontally or vertically adjacent positions. So, the corners have a capacity of 2, the remaining border positions have a capacity of 3 and the rest have a capacity of 4. When a stack's height is at or over the capacity of the position it stands on, it'll 'explode' (hence the game's name). I.e. each orthogonal neighbour receives 1 additional stone on top of the stack standing there and the exploding stack is reduced by the position's capacity. Explosions will cascade until all stacks are below capacity.     The name Explocus is a contraction of 'explosive' and 'Focus', the latter being a game by Sid Sackson (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(board_game) ) that provided the basic stack movement rules (stack height = move distance). The same stack movement is used in Dipole by Mark Steere. Explocus was the precursor to Atlantis, a multi-player game on a hexagonal board of arbitrary size and shape (see http://www.spelmagazijn.nl/nl/intvw16.html), which has become popular among the students of the Dutch \"University Twente\" in particular the members of board game club \"Fanaat\" (see http://www.fanaat.utwente.nl/) of which I once was a member.   This implementation deploys the (very simple!) evaluation function that Christian Freeling and Anneke Treep developed a long time ago, partly to demonstrate that complex movements (explosions) don't bother a computer player but is very difficult to envision by humans. Being able to look ahead a couple of ply makes the computer virtually unbeatable in this game. This in contrast to a game like Havannah, which has very simple movement rules yet deemed unprogrammable by the inventor.     Please note: When a game has ended, ZoG will display a dialog that announces the correct  outcome of a game.  However, after that dialog is dismissed, another extraneous  dialog pops up that always calls it a stalemate.  This dialog is not a serious problem, it's just an annoyance - simply ignore it.   This implementation uses the \"Axiom\" Meta-game engine."],"image":"game1491_scr_Explocus.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12,39],"variations":0}

In Frisian draughts the objective is to capture all your opponent's pieces (draughts and wolves).","Pieces move by sliding diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. Draughts capture in all directions, also orthogonally, on squares of the same colour. They promote to wolves on the back row (the Frisian name for the King is \"wolf\"). Wolves may move forwards or backwards on the diagonals. They capture in all directions (also orthogonally, on squares of the same colour) and land anywhere behind the captured piece.","The wolf may only slide three times in a row. Then he must be set free by capture, or by the move of any other of the same player's pieces. This rule is not valid if the player has only wolves left. In endgames with two wolves against one, the stronger party must win in seven moves, otherwise it's declared a draw. Stalemate is a loss.","It is mandatory to select the longest capturing line. If even, one must give precedence to the capture of a wolf. Otherwise, the wolf's capturing move has precedence. Thus, if a wolf can capture two wolves and a draught can capture three draughts, then preference is given to the latter. However, Frisian draughts is sometimes played with more complicated rules. Accordingly, two wolves shall be counted as 4 - (1/2) = 3½. This is more than 3 draughts, which means that preference should be given to the wolf's move.","Frisian Draughts is similar to International Draughts. The main difference is that both men and wolves (kings) may capture orthogonally as well as diagonally. If you want to set up a position, even if the program is not likely to malfunction, the preferable method is to choose the \"empty board\" alternative.","Can draughts capture backward? Yes.","Does a draught continue jumping after reaching last rank? Yes.","...and can he be crowned and continue jumping? No.","Can wolves move any number of squares? Yes.","Are captured pieces left on the board until after the move? Yes.","Must you choose the move capturing the most pieces? Yes.","...and if even, give precedence to the wolf's capturing move before the draught's capturing move? Yes.","Must you give precedence to the capture of a wolf to the capture of a draught? Yes.","Must you give precedence to the capture of two draughts to the capture of one wolf? Yes.","Discussion","The game was mentioned first time in a book by Swaanenburg, printed in Amsterdam 1725. Around 1750 Lars (Lorentz) Mollberg (1734-1772) visited his relatives in Amsterdam. Apparantly he brought the game back to Stockholm where he played it in the sixties. Carl Michael Bellman (1740-95; famous Swedish writer and lyric poet) mentions it in a poem from 1783, about the 'marquern'-playing corporal Mollberg. The game seems to have survived for a time in Stockholm, as Carl Johan Billberg mentions the game in his game book from 1838-39.","By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage generally leads to a win. But two wolves against one wolf is regarded as a draw after seven moves. A rule of thumb is that the wolf's value is equal to 2 draughts. If both parties have a wolf, subsequent wolves are of less value.","A good strategy is to try and get the first wolf, because this piece will cause a lot of damage to the opponent, provided he cannot capture the wolf quickly. You should try to hinder the opponent from getting a wolf, by keeping your lines closed so that he cannot break through. Remember that pieces can capture backwards, so you do not necessarily need to keep a thick layer of draughts in the last rows. Pieces that are too far advanced become fragile. You should try to keep your side organised in effective blocks, instead of spreading them out in many isolated pieces.","In my program, the Frisian rules are all enforced, except the seven moves rule in endgames with two wolves against one. The player can himself decide that it's a draw, with the aid of the moves list. Nor is the trivial wolf vs. wolf draw enforced.","I created this zrf since Frisian draughts on the Zillons CD is faulty (the wolf sometimes makes additional captures after the move sequence has ended). Moreover, the Zillions implementation of Frisian draughts ignores the rule that the wolf capture takes precedence over the draught's capture when equal in number. It also ignores the rule that wolves may only slide three times in a row, whereupon the wolf must be \"set free\"."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":3}

Two Dames are sufficient for a win against a lone Dame.","Except for deferred orthogonal capture, the game differs from traditional Frisian Draughts only in these respects: (1) the Dame halt rule (2) there is no restriction in how many times in a row a Dame may slide. This game is also suitable for playing on an 8x8 board (\"Frisian Checkers 2.0\" 8x8).","History","Frisian Draughts (the forbear of this variant) is played in some areas of the Netherlands. It emerged during the 17th century in the northern province of Friesland. During the 18th century it became popular also outside the Netherlands, such as in Paris and Stockholm. This new variant is a proposal of undersigned.","Strategy","Notice that this game retains much of the exciting combinatorial possibilities of Frisian draughts. Although a Man can also capture orthogonally and backwards, it may only do this later, as part of a series. By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage generally leads to a win. A good strategy is to try and get the first Dame, because this piece will cause a lot of damage to the opponent, provided he cannot capture the Dame quickly. Try to hinder the opponent from getting a Dame, by keeping your lines closed so that he cannot break through. Pieces that are moved forward too much are fragile. Since a Man cannot capture backwards as immediate move, a good idea is to keep a Man or two as rear guards. Rule of thumb: try to keep your side organized in effective blocks, instead of spreading them out in many isolated pieces."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":2}

The  players take turns placing stones on empty points on the board,  with Black going first.  The object of the game is to form a  chain of friendly stones connecting two opposite sides of the  board.  A player can win by connecting the top edge to the  bottom edge, or the left edge to the right edge.  The four corner  points count in both left-right and top-bottom connections.   Diagonally adjacent stones are not connected.","Gonnect incorporates the capture rules of Go.  If placing a stone  results in the complete surrounding of an enemy group of stones,  with no holes in that group, then the entire enemy group is  captured and removed from the board.  Both friendly stones and  the board edge are counted when determining whether an enemy  group is surrounded.  The empty points adjacent to a group of  connected friendly stones are called that group's 'liberties.'   Capturing occurs when the liberty of a group is reduced to zero.   A single stone is considered a group of one.  Only orthogonal  connnections are considered in determining captures and counting  liberties.  A player cannot commit suicide by placing a stone  into a group whose liberties are reduced to zero as a result of  the move.  Capturing moves are always permitted and can never  constitute a prohibited suicide.","Gonnect also uses the Go rule of \"Ko,\" which is described in  detail in the \"Game Description\" section under the Help menu.   Unlike in Go, players cannot pass in Gonnect.  This means that  the two-eyed groups considered uncapturable in Go can in fact  be captured in Gonnect.  As the board fills up, a player may be  forced to drop a stone into one of two eyes in a friendly group,  thus permitting the opponent to play a stone in the remaining  eye and capture the group.","Gonnect adopts the 'pie' rule commonly used in Hex.

Parker","created":"2002-05-18","notes":"1932","description":["Grand Camelot is a four-handed partnership version of George S. Parker's famous boardgame Camelot. The original Camelot was invented by Parker in 1887, and Grand Camelot was released in 1932. To learn more about Grand Camelot and other variations of Camelot, please visit the web site of the World Camelot Federation at http://communities.msn.com/worldcamelotfederation.  Grand Camelot is played on a 16x16 board with 19 squares removed from each corner to give the board a roundish appearance. Two spaces protrude from each of the board's four sides. These are called the \"castles.\" There are four players who form two partnerships: Red and Blue versus Green and Yellow. The turn order is Red Green Blue Yellow. The object of the game is for a partnership to move two of its pieces into the opponents' castles. A player can move his pieces only into the castle on the opposite side of the board, called the \"goal\" castle. For example, Red's pieces can occupy only the castle squares behind Green in the initial array. A partnership wins when any two opponent castle squares are occupied. A victory for the Red-Blue partnership could consist of two Red pieces in the Green castle, two Blue pieces in the Yellow castle, or one in each. You also win by capturing all of the opposing partnership's pieces, provided your partnership has at least two pieces remaining. A draw is declared if both partnerships are reduced to a single piece. If one player loses all his pieces, his partner can continue to play, with the depleted player's turn treated as a pass. A player who has no moves forfeits the turn. The Knight graphic in the upper left corner keeps track of whose turn it is. If it is your turn and you have no move, click the Knight to forfeit your turn.  Each player starts the game with twelve pieces, consisting of eight Men and four Knights. A Man has three basic moves. It may move one space in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal. This is called the \"plain\" move. It may jump over a friendly adjacent piece and continue jumping, at its option, as long as friendly pieces remain to be jumped. This move is called \"cantering.\" And it may jump over an enemy piece, thereby capturing it, in which case it must continue jumping as long as captures are available. A Man may not canter and capture in the same move.  The Knight has all the moves of the Man plus one important addition, called the Knight's \"charge.\" A charge consists of a cantering move (or series) followed by capturing. Once a Knight makes a capture, it must continue making captures if available and may not return to cantering.  Circular canters, i.e., canters that return to an already visited square, are not permitted. Visited squares are indicated by flags, which are cleared at the end of the cantering sequence. To pass on further canters, click the piece and move it to the indicated off-board position in the lower left or upper right corner of the board. The piece will not actually change location.  Capturing is compulsory but there is no requirement of choosing a path of maximal captures. A player is not required to make a Knight's charge, with the exception that when a capture is directly available, the player may satisfy the compulsory capture rule through a Knight's charge. When cantering a Knight must make a capture if one becomes directly available but may do so through a charge.  Special rules govern the castle. Once a piece enters its goal castle, it may never leave. A piece in a goal castle is permitted to move laterally twice during the game. A piece can enter a non-goal castle only when capturing, in which case the piece must be moved out as soon as possible. If the piece cannot move out through another capture on the same turn, then it must be moved out on the next turn (even if this means declining a capture elsewhere on the board). When moving out of the castle, priority is given to capturing or charge moves.  The Green player was White in the original production of Grand Camelot.

Pieces have gender, can 'mate', give birth, age and die.  The game is won by the player whose population lives longest or who connects two sides of the board.","The unusual theme of the game keeps it fun whilst also enabling considerable strategic variety and depth.","BOARD AND PIECE DESCRIPTION: The game is played on a 6x6 board.  One player is Copper, the other Teal.  Male pieces are represented by triangles, females by circles.  Each piece also has a number written on it.  This is the piece's remaining life turns (lifespan) i.e. number of 'turns' left before it dies (higher numbers meaning greater longevity).  The remaining life reserve for both players is displayed on the left side of the board.  The life reserve is the supply of life turns that can be drawn from and allocated to pieces that a player introduces to the board during the placement phase.","TURNS:  There are four phases in each 'turn' (the last two phases being automatic):","Placement/Movement - Each player either places a new piece on the board or moves an existing piece.","Birth - Each player gives birth, if they wish, anywhere where the conditions for birth are met.","Ageing - All pieces age (their remaining life turns are reduced by one).","Death - Pieces that have no life turns left will die (disappear), and any player who has met one of the objects of the game wins.","OBJECTS:  The game can be won in either of two ways both assessed only after the ageing/dying phase of each turn:","If one player is the only one with pieces left alive.  This includes the other player having no reserve life turns (so a player is still alive if they have no pieces on the board provided they have at least one reserve life turn left to make a placement in the following turn.)","By one player connecting two sides of the board through a continuous series of their pieces which are all orthogonally connected.  For Teal, this will be connecting the two vertical sides, for Copper, top and bottom.","Please refer to 'reaper.pdf' for complete game instructions and examples.","Note: Grim Reaper is playable as a PbEM game at Super Duper Games:","http://superdupergames.org/","NOTES ABOUT THE PROGRAM:","When placing new pieces, the choice of available life turns of the pieces is restricted (e.g. typically 5 or 3). This is a slight deviation from the rules which was done in order to reduce the number of choices and thereby improve the effectiveness of the AI.","In some cases it is possible for multiple mothers to give birth at the same position.  In that case, the program will pop up a menu that allows the player to select which mother is to give birth.  This is an important distinction because females can only give birth to one piece each birthing time.","As of this writing, Grim Reaper is the most complex Axiom game.  Because new pieces with varying life turn values can be dropped on the board and existing pieces can move, the game has a fairly high branching factor.  In addition, the dual goals of survival and connection along with the need to manage life turns and the many phases, meant that   developing a competent AI has been a formidable challenge.  At one point during its development a neural network based evaluation was tried (See GRNN.jpg to view the network architecture). The neural network was constructed by creating a population of genetically evolving neural networks which played against each other in hundreds of tournaments.  The fittest networks survived and were transplanted into the program.  Although, this approach yielded a stronger opponent than the initial hand-crafted AI, an even stronger AI was eventually developed by hand tuning the evaluation weighting factors and testing play strength via the AutoPlay program.  What we found with the neural network was that one net would manage survival well while another net would be good at connecting, but we never managed to find a single net that was good at managing both goals."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12,39],"variations":0}

To stop leaping prematurely, select 'Pass Move' from the menus or the toolbar.","Note that in all these new versions of Halma it is not allowable to jump or step backwards (i.e. in the direction of one's own yard). In the above picture it would mean that the red pieces are not allowed to move east, south, or south-east.","Traditional Halma is a simple draw, since neither side is forced to move all its counters out of its starting position. In this version, if a counter in its home position can make progress outward by jumping an enemy counter it must do so (a rule invented by S. Sackson).","Since a counter which has just jumped can continue jumping, you should try to form 'ladders' of jumpable counters to more quickly get your counters down the board. Try to avoid that the opponent can jump via your own counters.","These variants have been invented by me (Dec 2005) and are inspired by the Halma variant Grasshopper. Original Halma, (the big 16 square version) was invented in 1883 by the Harvard Medical School surgeon, George Howard Monks. Original Halma caught on in England, and to some extent in Germany, but otherwise hasn't had much success, although it became the favorite game of the last Empress of Russia, Alexandra Feodorovna.

Here's the story in a nutshell: A late arrival.","Rules","Board The board is a rectangle of 9x13 squares, with two additional goals of 1x3 squares. There are two 'goal areas' of 2x5 squares. Both players, White and Black, have 11 pieces: 1 Keeper, 2 Lions, 4 Elephants and 4 Horses.","The diagram shows the board with the pieces in the initial position. The ball lies in the centersquare.","Object The object of HanniBall is to shoot the ball into the opponent's goal. If a player shoots the ball into his own goal, he loses the game.","Moving and capturing White begins and players move in turn. Each turn a player is allowed to make up to 4 moves, which must lead to at least one change in the position. However, white on his first turn may make no more than 2 moves. A 'move' may be:","Moving a piece that does not have the ball.","Moving a piece that does have the ball, with or without it (the latter barring the Keeper).","Shooting the ball.","Shooting the ball can only be done by a piece that has the ball in its possesion. The pieces move and shoot as follows:","The Horse moves as the knight in Chess, but may not jump to its target square if both the in between squares are occupied by opponent's pieces. A Horse shoots the ball 'king's move' wise. If a Horse shoots the ball, it lands on a straight or diagonally adjacent square.","Note that a knight's move is always possible between a cornersquare of the goal and the backrow of the field on that side (for instance b2 and d1), because there are no two intermediate squares beween these squares.","The Elephant moves as the king in Chess. An Elephant shoots the ball 'knight's move' wise. If an Elephant shoots the ball, it lands on a square one knight's move away, no restrictions.","The Lion combines the options of Knight and Elephant, so it moves and shoots either way in any combination.","The Keeper moves as a Lion, but may not leave the goal area (except for the goal itself). A Keeper in possesion of the ball, may not let go of it other than by shooting it (that is, he may not move and leave the ball behind). A Keeper shoots the ball up to five squares away, queenwise. Direction and distance are the player's choice, but the ball must land outside the goal area.","Inside the goal the Keeper or a defender should not have the ball in its possession, because a ball inside the own goal ends the game in a win for the opponent.","The Ball The Ball may land on any square, whether or not occupied.","If a piece moves to a square where the ball is, it takes possession of the ball.","If the ball lands on a square occupied by a piece, other than a Keeper, the piece takes possesion of the ball.","If a player is in possesion of the ball, and it is his turn, and he has still one or more move options left, than he can do one or more of the following:","Shoot the ball.","Move the piece and take the ball along.","Barring the Keeper: move the piece and leave the ball.","Move another piece.","If a player is in possesion of the ball, and it is not his turn, then the piece holding the ball can be captured by the opponent. Capture is by replacement. The captured piece is taken off the board, and the capturing piece takes possession of the ball.","Please note that if a player shoots the ball to an opponent's piece, and he has still one or more move options left, he may, if he can, capture that piece!","Shots at the goal or the Keeper","If a player shoots the ball into the opponent's goal, he wins the game. If he shoots it into his own goal he loses.","If the ball is shot to a square occupied by a Keeper of either side, the ball 'ricochets' off the Keeper, queenwise, up to five squares, but not into the goal (though it may land in the goal area). Direction and distance are determined by the shooting player, whether the shot is directed at a player's own Keeper or the opponent's Keeper.","Note that a Keeper can only take possession of the ball by picking it up in the goal area, or by capturing a piece there, that is in possesion of the ball. A Keeper in possesion of the ball risks capture like any other piece.","Obstruction Obstruction is a 'red card' offense against the rules. It is permitted, but may and usually will be punished.","If a player on his turn finds a position in which he has at least one piece other than a Keeper, and not one of his pieces can reach the ball in any number of moves, then the opponent has committed obstruction and the player to move may (but is not obliged to) remove one of the opponent's pieces from the board as his first move. This may or may not be a blocking piece.","If the obstruction is still in place at the beginning of the blocking player's next turn, it is up to him to undo the obstruction, or risk having yet another piece removed.","In this implementation, when you have a choice what to move,","e.g. hold the ball, shoot the ball or leave the ball,","just drag the piece to the target square and a menu pops up","to choose the right move from. I just hope it's clear enough.","When there's no choice the system makes the proper move automatically.","To punish a 'red card' offense simply click the opponent's piece you want removed.","Enjoy!"],"image":"game1735_scr_HanniBall.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":0}

Now the white man can jump the black man, landing on the third (vacant) square and removing the jumped man from play. That's checkers type capture. Alternatively, the white man can jump the black man and taking it along underneath as a prisoner, landing on the third square. That's column checkers capture.  Now with a little imagination, one can see a man capturing several men as prisoners in a multiple capture. Next imagine this piece itself is jumped by the opponent: the guard is captured and the prisoners are now released! This released column can now in turn start to make prisoners and these will buried under several guards - to release them, the piece must be jumped a corresponding number of times!That's the general idea, and the most significant difference with checkers type capture is that no pieces ever leave the board!

All stones in a stack belong to the same player. Players take turns in moving one of his stacks. A stack moves exactly as far as it's high in any direction.  It is allowed, however, to split the stack in accordance with the move distance. E.g. if the piece to move is a stack of 3 and you want to move 2 squares, the top 2 stones will be taken to the destination cell and 1 stone will remain on the old position.   A stack may land on top of another stack, friend or foe, creating a larger stack (the sum of both). All stones in the resulting stack are then owned by the moving player.   The capacity of a board position is defined as the total number of adjacent positions. So, on a hexagonal board, the corners have a capacity of 3, the remaining border positions have a capacity of 4 and the rest have a capacity of 6. When a stack's height is at or over the capacity of the position it stands on, it'll 'explode'. I.e. each neighbour receives 1 additional stone on top of the stack standing there and the exploding stack is reduced by the position's capacity. Explosions will cascade until all stacks are below capacity.      HExplocus is the hexagonal version of Explocus, invented by Martin Medema around 1980. HExplocus turns out to be a bit friendlier to the human, because the bigger board and higher capacity makes play a bit more strategic. The name Explocus is a contraction of 'explosive' and 'Focus', the latter being a game by Sid Sackson (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(board_game) ) that provided the basic stack movement rule (stack height = move distance).

Troyka","created":"2002-09-21","description":["Hitchhiker Chess provides yet another question to science fiction's most famous answer:  Forty-two.  The game is based on Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker Guide To The Galaxy series.  It is played in a diamond-shaped galaxy consisting of forty-two squares, including a restaurant at either end.  In the center of the galaxy is a black hole.  The middle row of the board wraps around from one edge to the other.  The object of the game is to move your Hitchhiker across the galaxy into your opponent's restaurant.  You can also win by kidnapping the opponent Hitchhiker and dropping it into the black hole.","No piece can occupy the black hole, and sliding pieces cannot move across it.  A player must make a move if one is possible.  If no move is possible, the turn is forfeited.  Each player begins the game with fourteen pieces of six different piece types.  These are:","VOGON SPACE MINE","The Vogon Space Mine is used in construction of the intergalactic hyperway system.  Celestial bodies that block planned routes are destroyed through detonation of a mine.  Inhabitants are usually given three minutes notice, sometimes four.","The Mine moves one space diagonally or two spaces orthogonally, making its coverage a diamond shape.  When moving orthogonally the space traveled through must be empty.  It does not capture on white squares, called \"space,\" where it serves merely as a block.  The Mine is normally bound to space.  However, when it passes through the cross-galactic Mobius loop (the wraparound sixth row) it re-emerges on the dark squares, called \"antispace.\"  In antispace the Mine gains the power of detonation.  By clicking and releasing the Mine, it and all orthogonally adjacent pieces, friend or foe, are exploded and removed from the board.  Detonation of a live Mine can be prevented by capture but the capturing piece itself is exploded.","GOLGAFRINCHAN DEEP SPACE COLONIZER","The Golgafrinchan Deep Space Colonizer stands eight kilometers tall and is used for transporting useless elements of society to remote parts of the galaxy for resettlement under false pretenses of imminent destruction of the home planet.  On an unrelated note, chess variant designers beware!  A comet will soon be striking Earth and you have all been selected for salvation using the latest in Elbonian slingshot technology.  Stay tuned for further details!","The Colonizer moves to an adjacent square, orthogonal or diagonal, and captures by replacement.  Alternatively, it can plunge into the black hole and re-emerge in the mirror opposite square on the other side, capturing any enemy piece it lands on.  A Colonizer on c5, for example, can plunge through the black hole to position g7.  A Colonizer cannot capture an enemy Colonizer when plunging.","MAGRATHEAN ORBITER","The Magrathean Orbiter is custom built by the planet makers of Magrathea.  The Earth model featured here became popular after the ban on galactic cock-fighting.  The inhabitants that come with these planets are designed to engage in constant warfare for the amusement of their owners.  They provide a rich source of betting among capitalist galaxeers.","The Orbiter moves in a diamond orbit around the black hole, clockwise or counterclockwise.  It moves through any number of empty spaces, turning corners as it goes, and captures by replacement.  It is color-bound when moving in orbit.  The Orbiter changes orbit by moving one orthogonal space.  It cannot capture when changing orbit.","HYPERGALACTIC IMPROBABILITY ROCKET","The Hypergalactic Improbability Rocket runs on both traditional photonic drive and quantum improbability.  The improbability drive operates by making less probable the continued existence of the rocket at its current location and at all other locations in the universe save one, until the rocket rematerializes at the now probable location.  With this drive the rocket can travel anywhere within the probability matrix of local particles.  For safety reasons the rocket is not allowed to rematerialize within a certain vicinity of unidentified massive objects (\"UMOS\").","The Rocket moves in a straight line forward or backward and captures by replacement.  Aternatively, it can rematerialize in any \"safe\" square on the board.  A square is safe if it is not adjacent to any enemy piece besides the Hitchhiker.","KAKRAFOON SUN","The Kakrafoon Sun scorches the enormous Rudlit Desert, which serves as staging area for performances of Disaster Area, the Galaxy's hottest sound and light show.  The shows often climax with the sailing into the sun of a mock ship designed to trigger photonic flares that arc across the void to lick the desert.","The Sun moves in a straight line, orthogonal or diagonal, to an empty square.  It captures by \"scorching\" an adjacent enemy piece.  To perform a scorch, click the Sun and place it on the enemy piece.  The Sun does not actually move, and the enemy piece disappears in a ball of flame.  The Sun cannot be captured if it has just moved.","HITCHHIKER","The Hitchhiker travels the galaxy on 30 Altairian dollars per day and steals to make up the difference.  It is represented here by the traditional angel of food service, who brings good fortune to all those who bestow kindness upon travelers, and whose image is the favorite target of the skeet shooters of MaxiMegalon Four.","The Hitchhiker cannot move by itself.  Instead, it hitches a ride with an adjacent moving piece, called the \"carrier.\"  Specifically, when an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent friend moves, the Hitchhiker follows and lands in the corresponding square.  The corresponding square is the space adjacent to the carrier's destination square preserving the same relative position.  If that square is occupied or off the board, the Hitchhiker stays behind, although the friend can still move.  The Hitchhiker cannot be captured and it blocks motion by other pieces.  The space it is on can be moved to or through only if the Hitchhiker is carried to a different space as part of the move.  The game is won by moving the Hitchhiker into the opposite restaurant.  An enemy Hitchhiker still in its restaurant does not block a winning move.","A player can also win by kidnapping the opponent Hitchhiker and dropping it into the black hole, where it is instantly vaporized.  The opponent Hitchhiker can be kidnapped only if it is abandoned, i.e., not adjacent to any friends.  A player carries a kidnapped Hitchhiker exactly like a friendly Hitchhiker, with the exception that it can be moved into the black hole but not into a restaurant.  It is possible to carry both Hitchhikers at once."],"image":"game492_scr_HitchhikerChess.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":0}

In HopperDame with promotion rule you win by capturing all the opponent's pieces. Pieces move forwards and sideways, orthogonally or diagonally, by shifting to an adjacent square, or by jumping over an adjacent friendly piece (also termed 'hopper'). Jumps must only occur over a piece of the same colour. It's not allowable to step or jump backwards. The exception to this is the \"king\", which can jump over any piece, and step in all directions.","To promote to king one must conquer the \"castles\", that is, the corner squares behind the enemy position, by holding both these positions with a piece, so called \"double-promotion\". If a piece steps or jumps into the enemy corner then it is promoted to king only if the other enemy corner is already occupied by a friendly piece. Also, a piece which steps into the corner square may later be promoted if the other corner has subsequently become occupied by a friendly piece. The promotion is then done by dropping the piece on the same square. But this costs a move.","HopperDame employs the rule of exchange-capture: the counter jumps over a friendly counter. If the square where it lands is occupied by an enemy counter, then this is captured. It is only when leaping that the counter can make captures. A leaping counter may continue to leap over friendly counters until there are no more to leap over or the player decides to stop. It's not allowable to jump back to the square you just came from. To stop leaping prematurely, press 'Pass Move'.","Note that capture is only made when jumping. Thus, a single piece cannot make a capture by itself. The exception to this is the king, which has an additional capture method: it can capture an adjacent enemy piece directly, like a king in chess.","There is also a faster variant of HopperDame. It is played with terminal rule: to win you must simply conquer the \"castles\", that is, the corner squares behind the enemy position, by holding both these positions with a piece.

In this type of game it's common practice to view the game as won by the player who has more pieces when it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken. So in these games I have set the condition for winning to five enemy stones in Gol-skuish, Challis-Ghutia, and Ratti-chitti-Bakri, and to three in Pretwa.

Dames (Kings) are \"long\" (i.e., can slide and jump any number of squares.). Game logic derives from Ed van Zon's HexDame and from Karl Scherer's Russian checkers. Although there already exists a Zillions standard implementation of Pool checkers, etc., it was necessary to create it anew, because all Zillions's implementations with \"long Dames\" (or \"long Kings\") are defective. (The Dame will erroneously continue a finished capture sequence in case two enemy pieces are positioned on the same diagonal, and the Dame captures from between them. Moreover, the Dame capture works incorrectly in Pool checkers, German checkers, and Russian checkers. In some positions it refrains from making the full capturing sequence.)","International Draughts (Polish draughts) is played on a 10x10 board with 20 pieces per player. The object is to capture all your opponent's men by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can move forward, by sliding diagonally to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in any direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. You must even choose beforehand the series of jumps that captures the most men. When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a Dame and can then move and capture forwards and backwards over any distance. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A Dame must also choose the line that makes the most captures.","Dam Lombok (Breakthrough) is played in Indonesia, and has also achieved some popularity in the Netherlands. Same as International Draughts, except that win is also achieved by becoming the first to promote a Man to King.","Canadian Checkers (or Canadian draughts) uses the same rules as International draughts, but the game is played on a 12x12 board with 30 pieces per player. Canadian Checkers was invented by the French settlers of Quebec, Canada. It was originally named Grand jeu de dames. It is unknown when the game was first played in Canada. The idea of an increased-size international draughts game is older still; boards with 12x12 squares were on sale in London in 1805 (cf. Wikipedia).","Sri Lankan Checkers (or Lankesian draughts) is the same as Canadian Checkers, except that the board is mirrored.","Dumm (or \"long draughts\") is played in South Africa. Dumm uses the same rules as Dame (International Draughts) but is played on a 14x14 board with 42 pieces per player. It is still played in Cape Town. (However, the old huff rule is not implemented here.)","Damii (Ghanaian draughts) is similar to International Draughts (board size 10x10). However, although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line (i.e. it is not necessary to choose the series of jumps that captures the most men). In Ghana, players use the huff rule, but this is not implemented here. Play is very fast-paced.","Nigerian Checkers (draughts) is the same as Damii, except that the single piece rule is not used.","Brazilian Checkers (Minor Polish draughts) is similar to Dame (International Draughts), but played on an 8x8 board with 12 pieces per player. If a Man makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square and can continue capturing, it is not promoted. This variant was known already in the 16th century, and possibly even earlier. It was a popular board game in Holland, especially in Amsterdam.","Philippine Checkers is the same as Brazilian checkers except that the board is mirrored. Players from Luzon, Panay, and part of Mindanao, play on the mirrored board. However, according to the World Dama Federation, it should be played on the regular board (same as Brazilian checkers.)","Pool Checkers is similar to International Draughts, but is played on an 8x8 board. Although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line (i.e. it is not necessary to choose the series of jumps that captures the most men). It is the same as Northern German checkers, which is played on a mirrored board. The first book covering German Draughts was the 155-page folio volume \"Die unterschiedlichen Spiel- und Vorstellungen des weltberühmten Damspiels\", which was published around 1700 in Nuremberg by Johann Wolfgang Schmidt (cf. checkers.wikia.com). In America, where it acquired the name Pool checkers, this variant has its own organization; the American Pool Checkers Association (APCA).","Jamaican Checkers (North German Checkers) is the same as Pool checkers. The only difference is the mirrored board. Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea. In 2013 the population was 2.715 million. A German population was established in Jamaica in the 1830's and some German words have entered the Jamaican vernacular (cf. Wikipedia).","Northern Slovakian Checkers is the same as Pool checkers except that there are only eight pieces per player.","Russian Checkers (Draughts-64, \"Russkie Shashki\") is the same as Pool Checkers, except that a Man is promoted to Dame during a capture sequence, if it makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square. Although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line. This variant is played in Russia, former Eastern Bloc countries, and in Israel. The International Draughts Federation (IDF) has adopted the name \"Draughts-64\".","Spantsiretti is the same as Russian Checkers, played on a 10x8 board.","Laotian Checkers is the same as International Draughts (board size 10x10), except that it is not mandatory to capture the longest line.","Ivorian/Paraguayan is the same as International Draughts (board size 10x10), except that the board is mirrored.","Swazi Checkers is played in Swaziland, officially the Kingdom of Eswatini. A Man can promote to Dame during a capture sequence. It is mandatory to capture the longest line. Pieces are immediately removed. However, a Dame cannot reverse capture direction. Board size is 8x8.","Note! In a separate ZRF I introduce variants with a special rule that serves to reduce drawishness: the Dame must stop on the first vacant square after the last captured piece, if and only if that piece is also a Dame. Thus, two Dames will always win against one Dame. I believe this is a significant improvement, especially for the 8x8 variants. This rule is fetched from \"Killer draughts\", which is also included."],"image":"game2332_scr_CheckersVariants.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":29}

Variants implemented are:","Siberian checkers (8x8) (Turkutaga) The number of checkers are eight, placed on black squares. Both Man and King capture orthogonally, but move diagonally. Although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line. A Man can capture forwards and to the sides, but not backwards. Pieces are removed instantly from the board. At promotion, capture terminates and the Man becomes a King. The King may fly over empty squares. Two Kings against one is sufficient for a win.","Eurasian checkers (8x8) (Turkish-Russian) The number of checkers are twelwe, placed on black squares. The movement rules are the same as in Siberian checkers, except that a Man can capture in all four orthogonal directions. If the promotion square is reached, and captures are still available, the Man promotes and capture continues.","Hoogland Checkers (8x8) This game follows the same rules as International Draughts, except that a King can capture another King (but not a Man) orthogonally. It allows two Kings to win against one in the endgame. It was invented by Herman Hoogland (Netherlands) in 1923. The game, which was then called \"International Checkers\", was promoted by Hoogland's magazine Checkerwereld until his death in 1956. The first tournament was played in La Haye in 1930. After World War II it spread to 20 countries, but vanished after his death. The game was called the \"Esperanto of Checkers\".","Herman Hoogland (October 31, 1891 in Utrecht - November 25, 1955 in Utrecht) was the first draughts world champion from the Netherlands. In 1912 he became world champion for the first time, and he dominated the game for over a decade. From 1923 onward Hoogland became an advocate for a different way of playing the game (cf. Wikipedia). Also a 10x10 variant has been implemented.","Babylonian Draughts (10x10) This game once rivalled International Draughts in popularity. It is similar to the latter, except that the Man captures on the orthogonals. The rules used here are likely the correct ones, because the game is very good. Capture is mandatory and one must choose the longest line. If a Man lands on a promotion square during capture, it continues capturing as a Man. A Man steps diagonally forward, but captures in the four orthogonal directions. A King slides diagonally and captures orthogonally. It makes long jumps to capture, like in International Draughts. Captured pieces are removed after the sequence. In an alternative variant, the King both slides and captures on diagonals as well as orthogonals. Variants where captured pieces are removed immediately, have also been implemented.","Piece movement The object is to capture all your opponent's men by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can step diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in an orthogonal direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as possible. When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a King and can then move and capture forwards and backwards over any distance.

The 64 square board is an 8x8 grid.","On the 36 square board, each player starts with 12 pieces filling his nearest two rows.  On the 64 square board, each player starts with 24 pieces filling his nearest three rows.","Play is by turns, each player make one move or one capture sequence during his turn.","All pieces move forward vertically or diagonally one square to an empty square.  Pieces can also move by hopping in one of the three forward directions any number of consecutive adjacent friendly pieces to the next empty square.  For example, a piece on c1 might hop friendly pieces on d2 and e3 to land on f4.  Pieces can never move backward or sideways unless as part of a capturing move (see below).","Pieces capture in all eight directions.  Capturing is not compulsory; a player may always choose to either move or capture.  Only the continuing part of a jumping capture is compulsory","Pieces capture by jumping or leaping.  Jump capture is like the familiar checkers capture -- the piece jumps over and thereby captures an adjacent enemy piece and lands on an empty square immediately beyond.  Jumping captures can be made vertically, horizontally, and diagonally forward and backward -- a total of 8 directions.  Jumping captures are multiple and a piece that can continue to jump must do so.  To leap, a piece moves a line of enemy pieces and lands on the empty square immediately beyond, capturing the enemy pieces.  Leaping captures can be made vertically, horizontally, and diagonally  forward and backward -- a total of 8 directions.  Leaping capture is not multiple and a single leaping capture ends the player's turn.","The first player to move a piece to his opponent's first rank so that it cannot immediately be captured is the winner.  The Zillions-of-Games implementation will report this as a checkmate because the piece is in effect checkmating an invisible king.

Click the board. One square tile will be dropped at the centre, and seven tiles will be dropped on each player's rack. You play Red against Blue. Each player had 40 pieces, of which only 7 are visible. Each square tile is different (the full set of path tiles has 102 pieces).   The player alternate placing pieces by moving them from the rack onto the board. A tile has to be placed next to an existing tile, with colours of connecting path pieces matching. The system will offer you only legal moves.   If the tile you placed has two neighbours or more, you have a free turn. Note that in this game you cannot pass a free turn! The empty positions on the racks are refilled after every move.   You win when you own either a loop or a continuous path connecting two opposite sides of the board. Note that you do not have to be the player who completes this loop or path, it only has to be of your colour. If none of the player can achieve such a loop or cross-board connection, the player with the longest path wins. (The self-crossing pieces of the path are then counted twice.) Note that this program does not issue a win message for the longest path.   The win-condition checks the situation after each move in the following sequence:  - is there a loop of your colour?  - is there a cross-board connection of your colour?  - is there a loop of your opponent's colour?  - is there a cross-board connection of your opponent's colour? In the first two cases you win, in the last two cases your opponent wins. So if player Red creates a red and blue loop at the same time, Red still wins, because the system will stop after it found the red loop.   If one of the players cannot place a tile (i.e. is stalemated), the game is over and the player with the longest path wins. The stalemated player can click the name (RED or BLUE) at the top to signal the end of the game, and the system will issue a DRAW message, since the system does not check for the longest path.   Variant 2: here you do not get free turns.   This game uses a set of 66 tiles. Each tile can occur up to 10 times. Please note that there is an alternative piece set available.

Troyka","created":"2001-05-05","description":["Kalah is a popular Mancala game commonly found on internet game sites, sometimes under the names Kalaha, Makalah, or simply Mancala. Its origins are murky but it appears likely that Kalah is not an indigenous game but rather a modern variant of the Indonesian game Congklak. The rules are as follows:  The board is divided into twelve holes and two stores. One player plays from the bottom six holes and the other plays from the top six. The stores are used for storing captured pieces. The right store is for the bottom player and the left store for the top player.  The game begins with four beans in each of the twelve holes. The bottom player goes first. A move is made by picking up the beans in a player's hole and sowing them one at a time counterclockwise around the board. Sowing begins with the hole immediately after the lift hole and continues until all the beans have been dropped. Beans are dropped in a player's store but not in the opponent's store. Unlike in Wari, beans are dropped in the lift hole on subsequent laps.  If the last bean is dropped in the player's store, the player gets another turn, which is indicated by a red strip. (You can get up to three extra turns this way.) If the last bean is dropped in an empty friendly hole, any beans in the opposing enemy hole are captured and the turn ends. If the last bean is dropped in an enemy hole or an occupied friendly hole, the turn ends.  The game ends when a player captures twenty-five beans or when all of one player's holes are empty. In the latter case, all remaining beans are awarded to the opponent. If it is your turn to move and you have no beans, you must click on an empty hole to award the remaining beans to the opponent. The winner is the player with the most captured beans at the end of the game.  In the variants, the players start with three, five, or six beans in each hole. A player wins by capturing more than half of all available beans (19 beans, 31 beans, or 37 beans, respectively).  Please send any comments or bug reports to dtroyka@justice.com.

It is an African checkers variant played on a special pattern that is different from the well-known Alquerque pattern. Whereas the Alquerque pattern reduces the number of diagonals, the Kharbaga pattern reduces the number of orthogonals. The result is a different game dynamic. It is a very attractive checkers variant, not the least drawish. Although the number of squares is only 42, the many movement freedoms of the pieces make it a complex game.","Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. The pieces can step in the three forward directions, and capture, by the short leap, in all directions. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters. Counters are promoted to Mullahs (Sultans) at the last rank. If the counter, during a capturing sequence, makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square, it does not promote to Mullah. The Mullah moves and captures in all directions. It can move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, and land anywhere behind a captured piece. Capture is obligatory. Two types of variants have been implemented, one in which captured counters stay on the board until the capturing sequence has ended, and one in which counters are removed instantly. Note that one must always choose the line with the most captures.","A counter moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an enemy counter and the point directly behind is vacant, then one must jump over it and capture it, as in checkers. Several pieces may be captured like this in a single turn.","I have also created a variant where counters can move backwards. It's unclear whether this variant is authentic. Nevertheless, it is an interesting variant because it works very fine."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":4}

A Man can move forward, by sliding diagonally to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in any direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. You must even choose beforehand the series of jumps that captures the most men.","When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a Dame and can then move and capture forwards and backwards over any distance. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A Dame must also choose the line that captures the most men. If a Man reaches the promotion square as part of a capture sequence, it does not promote.","The variant was invented by Christian Freeling.

Yellow enables friendly pieces to move one square diagonally.  Blue enables friendly pieces to move two squares orthogonally (horizontally or vertically).  Orange enables friendly pieces to move two squares diagonally.  Red enables friendly pieces to make \"vertical knight moves\", i.e., move two spaces vertically        and one space horizontally.  Green enables friendly pieces to make \"horizontal knight moves\", i.e., move two spaces horizontally \t  and one space vertically.      For example, a White Orange piece on a Blue square enables both of White's Blue pieces to move two    squares diagonally.","The game starts in a Placement Phase: two dots appear near the center of an empty board. Click a    dot, and select a color of square to drop. A new dot will appear, so the next square can be dropped    on either side. The squares will be centered automatically to allow more room. The two players    alternate. When one square of each color has been dropped, the squares are extended to columns of     the same color, and pieces are placed on their own color squares in the first two and last two rows.","Then the Movement Phase begins, where the object is to stalemate the opponent. Capture is by displacement.","Including the standard version, there are 36 variants, allowing for alternate move rules, and more    complex and/or random setups:","In the Public variants, the legal moves of each piece are determined by which *friendly and enemy*     pieces are currently sitting on squares of the piece's color. In the Reversed variants, the legal    moves of each piece are determined by which *enemy* pieces are currently sitting on squares of the    piece's color.","In the Flipped variants, the Black side of the board has the colors flipped left-to-right from White's,    instead of mirrored as in the standard variant.","In the Intermediate variants, after the initial row 4 of squares is set up, these are copied to row 3,    the players take turns setting up row 2 with one square of each color, and then this is copied to row 1.

You are presented with a double board. The left board has a Draughts-like setup and represents the Laska playing board. You move your pieces only on the left board. The second board displays in detail what is in each stack of tokens.   You start as Blue playing against Red. Blue has light blue 'Soldiers', Red has yellow 'Soldiers'. On the 7x7 board, each player starts with eleven Soldiers.   Soldiers move one step diagonally forward or capture an adjacent enemy piece by jumping over it diagonally forward. Jumps and secondary jumps are forced. (In the additional variants 3 and 4 only primary jumps are forced).   A single piece is considered to be a stack of height one. The top piece of a jumped stack is captured and placed underneath the capturing piece or stack. A column of several stacked pieces moves like on single piece. The maximum height of a stack is 18 pieces. On the left board special pieces with black cylindric base indicate that a stack consists of more than one piece.   Once a Soldier (or a Soldier on top of a stack) reaches the other side of the board, it promotes to an Officer, which can move and jump diagonally backwards and forward.   In this game Officers are marked by darker colours (blue and red), the Soldiers by light colours (light blue and yellow). A stack moves like a Soldier or Officer, depending on what the top piece ('Commander') of the stack is.   If after a jump you have an additional jump available, you are forced to execute this additional capture as well, and so on.   You win by capturing all your opponent's pieces or stalemating him/her. The Zillions AI plays Laska very well, so you can use this game to play against the Computer.   Variant 2 is played on a bigger 8x8 board. Variants 3 and 4:   Like variants 1 and 2, but secondary jumps are not forced. Variants 5 to 8:   Like variants 1 to 4, but you can see the left playing board only, the right board is invisible.   Please note that there is an alternative piece set available.      Graphics of coins: from the Broderbund Clickart Collection.     Related Zillions game: 'Mylaska'.  Note that in Mylaska secondary jumps are not forced.         Technical information:  Games with mixed stacks of pieces on board positions are notoriously hard to encode in Zillions,  because Zillions allows only one piece per board position.  This stopped me and other authors up to now to encode games like Laska in Zillions.  The dual-board method I invented here for Laska finally solves this problem and  might also be useful for encoding other games with stacked pieces.  One board is used for playing, the second board is used to display what is in each pile.

Click anywhere on the board to create a random wall maze. The creation of the maze might take a few seconds.   Then the players alternate dropping balls into the maze at any position except at an intersection.   The system will add balls of your colour at 'maze-adjacent' positions up to the next intersection. Once an intersection has only 2 open paths left, it does not count as an intersection anymore for the next move.   To compensate for the first player's advantage, the first player's first drop will not be expanded by the system, but result in only one ball to be dropped! (However, the first player can use this one ball to cut the longest path in two pieces, for example.)   The game is finished when all positions are filled. The player with the most balls (i.e., covering the most area) wins. To give the players some information who is ahead during the game, counters for the red and blue balls are displayed the right border.   The Zillions AI plays this game very strongly on the 15x15 board. (Give it at least 5 seconds per move). On the 25x25 board, it is clearly overwhelmed and needs at least 1 minute per move.   Variant 2: uses 25x25 board.      The name 'Maffy' is derived from 'Maze-Fill'.   Related Zillions game: Walls (which is a version of the popular game 'Boxes').  In contrast to 'Walls' (or 'Boxes'), in Maffy you have a nice maze given  as a playing board, which improves the board design and speeds the game up,  since the players do not have to construct the walls in a lenghty and  (on a large board) quite boring setup phase.  A further difference is that in Walls (Boxes) the players can claim an area at any time,  before a maze is built.  Finally, the special first-drop rule in Maffy balances the power between the players.

The Sultan (King) moves and captures in all directions. Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters.","There existed two variants of Medieval Alquerque. In one version the Sultan can only move one square (short Sultan), and captures by the short leap. This was foremostly played in countries within the Roman sphere of influence. In the other variant the Sultan moves any number of squares, and captures like the King in international draughts, landing anywhere behind the captured piece. This was foremostly played in countries within the Arabic sphere of influence. In Sultan endgames, a majority of at least two Sultans is necessary for a win.","The above rules are much different from the rules of Alquerque as they have hitherto been understood. The most interesting rule is that capture is uncompelled. What speaks in this games favour is that it's more interesting than the traditional rendition of Alquerque de doze, which, allegedly, was played without promotion, and where capture was compulsory.","A counter moves to an empty adjacent point.

The only difference is the following: in a capture sequence (but not single piece capture), if the last captured piece is a Dame (King), the captor must stop at the immediate next cell after the last jumped piece. This serves to reduce the drawishness of the game, since it means that three Dames will win against a lone Dame. Note that, unlike in Killer Draughts, the halt rule is not valid at single piece capture. For this implementation I have utilized game logic from Karl Scherer's Russian checkers and Ed van Zon's HexDame.","The object is to capture all your opponent's men by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can move forward, by sliding diagonally to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in any direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. You must even choose beforehand the series of jumps that captures the most men. When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a Dame and can then move and capture forwards and backwards over any distance. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A Dame must also choose the line that captures the most men. If a Man reaches the promotion square as part of a capture sequence, it does not promote.","History","In 1922, Dutch champion A.K.W. Damme proposed to use the Dame-halt rule after the final piece (Man or Dame) only. Around 2000, Christian Freeling proposed Killer Draughts by introducing condition \"only after a final Dame\". In 2016, Juri Anikejev suggested \"Killer light\" (Modern Draughts) by introducing \"only after a final Dame in multiple capture sequences\".","An interesting variant was suggested by World Champion H. Hoogland, in 1923. The Dame may also capture orthogonally, like the \"wolf\" in Frisian Draughts. Thus, two Dames win against a lone Dame. (This is implemented as a variant.)","Modern Checkers (8x8)","Modern Checkers (8x8) is played on an 8x8 board with 12 pieces per player. The only difference from Brazilian Checkers (Minor Polish draughts) is the following: in a capture sequence (but not single capture), the Dame must stop on the first vacant square after the last captured piece, if and only if that piece is also a Dame. Minor Polish draughts was known already in the 16th century, and possibly even earlier.

The only differences between Neo-Checkers and Anglo-Saxon draughts/checkers are the four extra pieces per side and the enlarged board, which is an 8x10 Capablanca/Gothic chess board stood on end. The object is to capture all your opponent's pieces (\"Checkers\" or \"Kings\") by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. Checkers can only move diagonally forward, either by sliding to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. When your Checker reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a King and can then also move diagonally backwards.","Checkers or Draughts has been played since medieval times, but was derived from a much older Arab game, Alquerque (see my Zillions implementation \"Medieval Alquerque\"). Strategy: plan ahead and try not to leave your opponent with multiple jumps. As long as possible, keep two guards at positions c1, g1, and b10, f10, respectively. Try to conquer space, especially in the centre, but avoid advancing too rashly because the advanced pieces may be attacked.","Traditional checkers is a superb game while it is suitable for both amateur and expert.

It also introduces ranged rifle or gun attacks as found in the Chess Battle variant invented in the Soviet Union 1933 by A.S. Yurgelevich. Having played that variant, I thought it would be interesting to create some gun capture pieces and play on a larger board. So there are pieces in the game which move and capture like traditional chess pieces, yet in addition they have the added capability of 'rifle' (gun) capture. That is to say, they can make a 'move' by sitting in place and indicating an opponent's piece to be captured along a diagonal or orthogonal, whichever the case may be. Imagine a rifle or big gun shooting at a target in a distance. That is what this type of capture tries to emulate. Notes on rifle capture: In the descriptions of the pieces, the terms 'gun' and 'rifle' are used interchangably; also, any piece with rifle has that capability in every direction, orthogonally and diagonally. Here are the ranges for the pieces which have gun capability: Helicopters-4 Tanks-3 Cavalry-3 Strongpoint-3 Infantry-2, Outpost-1.","Rooks, and Bishops (Tank, Cavalry); compared to their traditional counterparts (rook, bishop) these pieces (tank, cavalry) have limited movement. Instead of being able to slide in an unlimited fashion along open lines, each piece can instead 'leap' 1-4 squares. This means that the tank moves 1-4 orthogonally and can leap or 'move through' pieces along that line, and that the cavalry does the same along its diagonals. Remember that for both pieces, their gun capture capability is both orthogonal and diagonal.","The 2-star, 3-star, and 4-star generals have no gun capture but allow each player to approach the other's gun-capture pieces, by leaping into squares where there is no 'hostile gunfire.' These can be especially important when approaching the opponent's helicopter pieces, for the helicopters with their range-4 gun capture dominate the orthogonal and diagonal avenues of approach.","Blue goes first, then Red. There is no turn limit. Capture the opponent's 3 outposts and 2 strongpoints to win. A player left with no moves is stalemated and loses; in that case the last player who moved is the winner. Otherwise the first player to capture the other player's outposts and strongholds is the winner.","The back-lines: Each side's 1st rank is known as a 'backline.' The 1st rank is immune to the opponent's bomber and missile pieces. Some people refer to the back line as the 'bunker' or 'safe zone.' Note that this is a key feature to the game. The missile and bomber are by far the most powerful pieces in the game, so losing one or the other early on could be a big disadvantage. The lastline/'bunnker' feature allows both sides to protect these and the other less powerful pieces. If you have a bomber or missile available late in the game, and your opponent does not, it could turn the tide."],"image":"game1175_scr_Chess_Operational_2.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":0}

However, in 'Persephone' the player picks between either of the two games in which he wants to move a piece.  Captures still take precedence over any other move. So a player is forced to make a capture on a particular side of the board if possible.","A player wins when he manages to capture all of his opponents pieces that are on the same color of the checkerboard - either all the light pieces or all the dark pieces.  With two games at once, the chances of a draw are greatly reduced.  If one of the games is undecided, the other game can still be resolved for the win.","Other than this, the game follows the rules of Spanish Checkers.  This is played very much like Anglo-American Checkers, the main difference is that the Queen has a more substantial move along any number of vacant squares, including ones beyond a captured piece.

The goal is to transport your pieces to the opposite side of the board and occupy the eight central squares on the last rank. When a piece is placed there it loses its movability. In the first stage players take turns to drop pieces on the first rank. When all eight pieces have been dropped they may move one step according to their movement design, or jump over any piece in the same direction, provided that the destination square is empty. Diamonds move diagonally. Squares move orthogonally. Circles move in all directions. Triangles move diagonally forwards or straight backwards. Pieces are allowed to jump back to the previous square if they jump into the margin. This implies that triangles, in this special case, may move contrary to their movement rule. However, as it is only a take-back move it doesn't affect the game.","Pieces cannot capture. It's not allowable to place a piece on the side of the board (except for the destination squares). However, it's allowable to jump via the side of the board. It is permissible to move along the first rank and to place a piece on the initial squares so long as this piece hasn't left the initial squares. Multiple jumps are allowed and can be discontinued. It's only permissible to jump back to where you came from if the piece has landed on the margin (except the destination squares).","In Platonic Halma with \"advanced rules\" a piece may jump over multiple squares, as long as a single piece occupies the center square along the jump, and the other squares are empty. If the jumping piece is a circle, and the jumped piece is an enemy circle, then the latter is sent back to the first rank (or second if there are no free squares in the first). If the \"send-back\" jump will end in the margin (except the destination squares), then it is prohibited (a rule introduced in this implementation). A circle which is positioned on the first or the last rank is not sent back.","If an enemy piece, other than circle, occupies a position adjacent to a piece on any of the initial squares, then the latter is forced to immediately jump out (see below).","Note! When having performed a jump then you must always acknowledge that the jump sequence has ended by again lifting and dropping the piece on the same square.","If you have started jumping in the margin and realize that you cannot find your way out then you must go back the same way, since you are not allowed to discontinue the move, and place a piece in the margin. The same applies to triangles when they have jumped out into the margin and cannot find their way out. It's then allowable to jump back the same way, although this movement direction is normally not allowed for triangles. Should you end up in an eternal loop that goes back and forth, then the move is prohibited and must be taken back. This corrective movement, which only involves movement in the margins, is in practice never performed but is added due to technical reasons.","I have added an additional outjump-rule to prevent blocking of the goal-squares: if an enemy piece, other than circle, occupies a position adjacent to a piece on any of the initial squares, then the latter is forced to immediately jump out over the enemy piece, provided that the movement rule of the piece allows this and provided that the jump does not end in the margin. Circle's cannot cause outjump. They can easily make it to the goal squares anyway.","In Platonic Halma with \"simple rules\" you can only make short jumps, and there is no \"send-back\" rule."],"image":"game1184_scr_PlatonicHalma.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12,13,14],"variations":6}

The goal is to transport your pieces to the opposite side of the board and occupy the eight central squares on the last rank. When a piece is placed there it loses its movability. In the first stage players take turns to drop pieces on the first rank. When all seven pieces have been dropped they may move one step according to their movement design, or jump over any piece in the same direction, provided that the destination square is empty. Diamonds move diagonally. Squares move orthogonally, but not backwards. Circles move in all directions, except the backwards directions. Triangles move diagonally forwards or straight backwards. Pieces are allowed to jump back to the previous square if they jump into the margin. This implies that triangles, in this special case, may move contrary to their movement rule. However, as it is only a take-back move it doesn't affect the game.","Pieces cannot capture. It's not allowable to place a piece on the side of the board (except for the destination squares). However, it's allowable to jump via the side of the board. It is permissible to move along the first rank and to place a piece on the initial squares so long as this piece hasn't left the initial squares. Multiple jumps are allowed and can be discontinued. It's only permissible to jump back to where you came from if the piece has landed on the margin (except the destination squares).","In Pythagoreic Halma with \"advanced rules\" a piece may jump over multiple squares, as long as a single piece occupies the center square along the jump, and the other squares are empty. If the jumping piece is a circle, and the jumped piece is an enemy circle, then the latter is sent back to the first rank (or second if there are no free squares in the first). If the \"send-back\" jump will end in the margin (except the destination squares), then it is prohibited (a rule introduced in this implementation). A circle which is positioned on the first or the last rank is not sent back.","If an enemy piece, other than circle, occupies a position adjacent to a piece on any of the initial squares, then the latter is forced to immediately jump out (see below).","Note! When having performed a jump then you must always acknowledge that the jump sequence has ended by again lifting and dropping the piece on the same square.","If you have started jumping in the margin and realize that you cannot find your way out then you must go back the same way, since you are not allowed to discontinue the move, and place a piece in the margin. The same applies to triangles when they have jumped out into the margin and cannot find their way out. It's then allowable to jump back the same way, although this movement direction is normally not allowed for triangles. Should you end up in an eternal loop that goes back and forth, then the move is prohibited and must be taken back. This corrective movement, which only involves movement in the margins, is in practice never performed but is added due to technical reasons.","I have added an additional outjump-rule to prevent blocking of the goal-squares: if an enemy piece, other than circle, occupies a position adjacent to a piece on any of the initial squares, then the latter is forced to immediately jump out over the enemy piece, provided that the movement rule of the piece allows this and provided that the jump does not end in the margin. Circle's cannot cause outjump. They can easily make it to the goal squares anyway.","In Pythagoreic Halma with \"simple rules\" you can only make short jumps, and there is no \"send-back\" rule."],"image":"game1185_scr_PythagoreicHalma.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12,13,14],"variations":6}

Each player has 18 men and two types of 'markers'.  A marker has one or two vertical bars imprinted on its face.  A player's marker is the same color as his men.  There are two goal positions, one for each player, consisting of three locations.","OBJECT OF THE GAME: There are two ways to win in Quadrature.  One is to reduce the number of on-board, opposing men to two or less.  The other is to advance three of your men into the goal position in your furthest row.","BASIC MOVES: Players take turns making basic moves, one basic move per turn.  You begin your turn by moving one of your men one location directly forward, diagonally forward, or sideways to an unoccupied location.  If you have no moves available, you must sit the game out until you do have a move available.  Players are not otherwise allowed to pass on their turn.  If neither player has a move available, the game is a draw.  A draw can also occur due to repitition.","SQUARING: If you move to form a rectangle (henceforth 'rectangle') with horizontal and vertical sides defined by three of your men and one opposing man, you have 'squared' the opposing man.  At such time you must immediately remove your opponent's man from the board and replace it with one of your off-board pieces - this is called an 'exchange'.  Note that there is an unlimited supply of off-board pieces.  If the result of an exchange causes further 'squaring', then the current player continues to exchange pieces.  A single squaring and exchange can trigger a cascade of further squaring and exchanges.  The current player continues until no further exchanges are possible.  At that time, the turn is concluded.","You are not allowed to move a man to a location which is squared by your opponent. That is, you cannot move to form a rectangle defined by your moved man and three opposing men.  However, by way of exchange, you may add men onto locations which are squared by your opponent.","If, at the outset of your turn, opposing men are already squared by your men, you cannot begin you turn by exchanging said opposing men.  You must begin your turn with a basic move, and you can only initiate exchanges on opposing men which were squared by your current move, or which were squared by men which you added to the board during your current turn.","MARKER: If you make a non-squaring, sideways move while your marker is not on the board, your marker with the single bar, is placed on the board while it is still your turn. If you make a non-squaring, sideways move while your marker is on the board with the single bar showing, the marker is replaced with one that has two bars.  If your marker is on the board with double bars showing, you cannot make a non-squaring, sideways move.

Troyka","created":"2004-04-17","description":["Random Links is a connection game played on a randomly generated board.  The rules are the same as for Hex.  The players take turns claiming an empty space on the board, with Red going first.  The object is to form a chain connecting the player's two sides of the board.  Red seeks to connect the two red sides, and Blue seeks to connect the two blue sides.  Blue is given the option of claiming Red's first space as an equalizing move.  As in Hex, draws are impossible.  One player will always form a winning connection.  Click anywhere on the board to begin the game.","The board is created by randomly dropping walls into a 15x15 grid (25x25 in the variant).  The only restriction on wall placement is that four walls can never touch at a common point.  With this restriction, the board is guaranteed to be draw-proof.  Four walls meeting at a common point are necessary for spaces to be diagonally adjacent (i.e., touch only at a point).  Diagonally adjacent spaces can block an opponent connection without themselves being connected.  This is the formula for stalemate.  When diagonal connections are prohibited, the only way to block an opponent connection is to form a connection yourself.  The only way for a player to completely block the opponent is to place a chain of pieces separating the opponent's two sides.  Such a chain equals a winning connection, meaning that the only way to completely block an opponent is to win.","Walls are dropped into the grid until no further drops are possible.  The resulting spaces can take a variety of shapes consisting of one or more unit squares.  When a player clicks on a unit square within a space, all unit squares within that space are claimed.","Unlike Hex, neither player has a theoretical win.  The strategy-stealing proof of a first player win in Hex depends upon the symmetry of the board when rotated from the perspective of one player to the other.  This proof holds that if the second player has a forced win, the first player can steal this winning strategy by placing a random stone on the first turn and then adopting the second player's strategy.  An extra stone on the board can never harm the first player.  Because the first player can always steal a winning strategy from the second player, no such strategy exists for the second player.","With asymmetrical boards such as those generated in Random Links, the lack of symmetry generally prevents the first player from adopting any winning strategy that the second player might have.  For example, on a 3x11 Hex board, one player has a simple winning strategy along the short axis -- play in the middle of a row, then connect to an edge on the next two turns -- that cannot be stolen by the opponent.","Nonetheless, the first player in Random Links will normally have an advantage.  There are three basic forced win scenarios.  Red can have a forced win regardless of who goes first, Blue can have a forced win regardless of who goes first, or either player can have a forced win if given the first move.  The random generation of the board requires that the first two possibilities happen with equal frequency.  The third option always favors the first mover and thus gives Red a statistical advantage.","In order to neutralize Red's first move advantage, Blue is given the option of claiming Red's first move.  This is accomplished by clicking on the first space claimed by Red and converting it to Blue.  This is similar to the swap option commonly used in Hex, with the difference being that the players do not actually change places.","Win detection is turned off in the \"Freestyle\" variants, allowing you to fill up the entire board."],"image":"game984_scr_RandomLinks.gif","category":"other","themes":[4,12],"variations":4}

Jørgensen's game book from 1802 (\"Nyeste Dansk Spillebog\") a Scandinavian checkers variant called makvær  is described (pp.370-71). It is similar to Frisian draughts but uses an even stronger Dame that can slide on the orthogonals. This variant later came to be referred to as Scandinavian checkers. Sadly, it was incorrectly described by H. J. R. Murray, with the consequence that erroneous rule descriptions are now replete on the Internet. (These lead to a dull game that doesn't work.) Here follows the correct rules (although Jørgensen doesn't describe the rules in marked detail).","Scandinavian Checkers (or Scandinavian draughts) is played on a 10x10 or an 8x8 board, placed with the single dark corner to the right. The rules are similar to International Draughts, but pieces can also capture orthogonally, which is a rule that derives from Frisian draughts. A Man moves diagonally forward one step at a time. It can capture in all directions. (However, in the suggested alternative variants, it is not allowed to capture backwards.) Jumping over a piece captures it. Capture is mandatory, and one must always choose the line that captures the most pieces.","In the main variant, the Man may capture in all eight directions. (I have suggested two alternatives; in the variant with \"medium strong Man\" the Man may capture in all directions except backwards. In the \"weak Man\" variant the Man may capture only in the forward directions: north, north-east and north-west. All variants are quite good, but have different character.)","When a Man reaches the other end of the board (at the end of a capture sequence or by moving there) it becomes a Dame. A Dame can slide diagonally over empty squares and make \"long\" captures over empty squares, in all diagonal and orthogonal directions. It may also slide orthogonally, but on the dark colour squares only. (Thus, it is stronger than the \"Wolf\" in Frisian draughts.) Unlike the Man, it needn't land on the first empty square behind the captured piece. When making an orthogonal jump-capture, the capturing piece may only land on dark squares, while the other colour squares are neglected. Enemy pieces are captured one at a time, but several in sequence, if the position so allows.

The Sages try to kick the Fool into the goal on the opposite side. This wins the game. Pieces cannot be captured. A Sage slides in all directions, except diagonally southward. However, if the Fool is located diagonally southward, the Sage may move there to kick the Fool. A Sage slides and stops on a square in front of the Fool, which immediately continues in the same direction. The Fool can only be kicked in a direction which leads either to another Sage (of either colour) or the goal. (If this isn't the case, the Fool will not move when a Sage moves to kick him.)","Upon colliding, the Fool either bounces back toward the kicking Sage or deviates 90 degrees, in either of the two perpendicular directions. It may then continue to bounce on other Sages, but can now only deviate in the perpendicular directions. Only the first bounce is obligatory. (To pass, just lift and drop the Fool.) The Fool may stop anywhere on the later legs.","Importantly, the Sage can kick a Fool on an adjacent square by displacing it. (Otherwise, the Sage stops immediately before the Fool.) The Fool cannot move into the margin squares; but a Sage can move there. No more than one Sage can enter the friendly goal. A Sage cannot enter the enemy goal, but can pass over it. In the original rules, the first to score five points wins.","Here, White can kick the Fool all the way into the Red goal. The Fool will bounce back to the kicking Sage. Then it deviates to the left and hits the leftmost Sage. From there, it goes directly into the Red goal.","Discussion","According to the original rules, the Sage always takes the Fool's place when kicking it. But this means that it's possible to stop the enemy from kicking the Fool by placing a Sage immediately behind the latter. In this version, it can still be kicked to the sides. Moreover, when the Fool bounces back on the kicking Sage, there is one more square to land on. I believe this version makes the game more lively, and there's no reason to have the kinds of restrictions on piece configurations as in the original rules.","The original rules are better played with a rule amendment: The Fool may be lobbed over a Sage that blocks the Fool. The latter lands on an empty square behind the blocking piece. This can only occur if the kicking Sage is positioned next to the Fool, on the other side. In this way the Fool cannot be blocked easily. After the lob, the Fool stays where it lands and does not continue to bounce. This variant has also been implemented. Alternatively, the Fool deviates 45 degrees instead of 90 degrees. This makes the game harder.","Seven Sages (\"Les 7 sages\") was designed by Max Gerchambeau in 1980, and published by Jeux Robert Laffont in 1981.

Snakes move any number of spaces along the forward diagonals and capture by replacement.  The principal game strategy consists of getting under your opponent's defenses.

The opponent can defend only by moving snakes out from the snakepit area (the home corner), which substantially weakens the opponent's defense. The converse of this strategy is that you should try to keep a snake in your snakepit, with other snakes close by, as long as possible.

The docks are squares marked by an anchor. A player can also win by completely eliminating the enemy's fleet.  On a turn, a ship may sail forward, turn, or attack. Ships can not sail backwards or sideways, but only in the direction their prow is facing. Nor do ships sail straight forward, but at a 45 degree angle.  A ship can move forward one space diagonally to an empty square. A normal ship may stay within the same space and make a 90 degree turn to face a different compass direction. For example: a north-ship may turn to face the east or west.  Ships attack and sink other ships (let them be enemies or friends) by firing a broadside discharge of the cannons arranged along the port or starboard sides. So for a ship to attack another ship it must have one of its sides to the other ship. During an attack, a ship will plow through the other ship to the vacant square beyond. (e.g. captures are made by sideways, orthogonal jumps.) If a ship can attack another ship, it is forced to do so. Multiple shots are NOT possible.

Pieces move one orthogonal space and capture by replacement.  The board is five-dimensional (2x2x2x2x2). The initial board set-up consists of a piece in its portal surrounded on all five sides by friendly pieces.  The board is constructed as follows: The two 2x2 boards on the bottom left form a regular 3D board. The two 2x2 boards on the bottom right also form a regular 3D board. These two 3D boards are connected through the fourth dimension, such that each space in one 3D board is orthogonally adjacent to its counterpart in the other. The two 3D boards on the bottom thus form a 4D board. The two 3D boards on the top similarly form a 4D board. These two 4D boards are connected through the fifth dimension. The entire 5D board is symmetrical. Any eight spaces that share two common dimensions may be considered a 3D board, and any sixteen spaces that share one common dimension may be considered a 4D board.  Any corner space in a cube of n dimensions will always have a unique \"opposite\" corner that is n orthogonal moves away. In a square, it takes two orthogonal moves to go from one corner to the other. In a cube, it takes three orthogonal moves. In a 4D hypercube, it takes four moves, and in a 5D hypercube, used in Skava, it takes five moves. Thus, it takes five orthogonal moves to go from black's portal to white's portal.

A player moves one of their pieces to an unoccupied adjacent space, either vertically, horizontally or vertically (depends on variant). B. Jump move:   1. A player jumps one of their pieces over a piece, either theirs or their opponents, and lands on an empty space.   2. The pieces jumped over then is flipped over and its color (or pattern) is changed.  It is possible by jumping over a piece a player could cause a winning condition for their opponent.  In this case, the player's opponent would win the game.  In the event that such a move would cause both players to reach a winning condition, the players' opponent would be considered to be the victor.","Description of variants:  No diagonal win.  Players win only if they get a certain number of pieces in a row in a line vertically or horizontally.  The number in a row needed depends on variant. Diagonal win. Players also win the game if they get a certain number of pieces in a row diagonally. No diagonal movement.  Pieces only move vertically and/or horizontally (neither jump capture nor slide diagonal also). Diagonal movement.  Pieces also can move (slide or jump) diagonally. 4x4 board or 6x6 board. The 6x6 board leads to a more strategic type game. (N pieces each).  N = the number of pieces a player gets at start of game. N in a row.  N = the number of pieces in a row needed to win.","Closing Comments:     I found a used copy of Rubik's Magic at a flea market for 50 cents, along with some other games. I purchased it and found out  it was missing the rules.  Upon pondering what the rules might be for the game, I came up with the rules above, with the exception  of placing pieces down either color side up (I added this rule later).  I tried the game with other people and found out that it  played real well and people enjoyed it.  I later found out what the actual rules were to Rubik's Magic.  With the exception of the  types of pieces that are used, the rules I created for the game are almost completely different than those of Rubik's Magic.","I do want to thank Guenther Rosenbaum and David Wichert for helping to get this game implemented in Zillions.

The player with the most knights in their end zone wins.  In case of a tie, the player whose move ended the game wins.","MOVEMENT: Players move alternately, white opens.  The knights move in an L-shaped fashion as in Chess.","A player must make either a simple or a compound move.","1. Simple move: A simple move consists of the player moving a knight to an empty square.","2. Compound move: A compound move consists of moving a single knight through three stages: Charge, Pounce, and Finish.","2a. Charge Stage: During the charge stage, the player moves a knight so that it lands on on either a friendly or enemy knight. This move can be repeated with the same knight landing on other knights.  During this stage, a knight may not touch the ground, only another knight.  For each enemy knight that the knight lands on, a charge is accumulated.  The charge indicator displays the total amount of charges accumulated for the current player.  The player ends this stage by pressing the \"pounce button\" (labeled with a \"P\").  When this occurs, the pounce stage is entered.  Note that the charge stage always ends with the knight ontop of another knight.","2b. Pounce Stage: The charge indicator now displays the number of remaining moves the player is allowed to make during the pounce stage.  It is possible for there to be no remaining moves, if during the charge stage, the player only touched friendly knights (in that case, the charge indicator displays a value of 0).  During the pounce stage, there are no restrictions on the landing square.  However, if a player lands on an occupied square, the friend or enemy knight occupying that square is removed.  The pounce stage ends once the charge count has expired.","2c. Finish Stage: The finish stage consists of the knight moving onto an empty square.  Note that this is not the same as ending the pounce stage on an empty square.  The finish stage is mandatory and cannot be skipped.  In all cases, the finish stage requires that the knight be moved to an empty square.","During a compound move, players cannot visit the same square twice, even across different stages.","Note: In the relatively rare case where a stage cannot be performed, the only move available is to remove the knight.","If a player finishes a move and the knight is in the end zone, then it becomes \"anchored\".  An anchored knight cannot move, be destroyed, or be jumped on during the pounce stage.  However, an anchored knight can be jumped on during the charge stage and when landing on an opponent's anchored knight, a charge is accumulated. During the pounce stage, knights can enter the end zone as long as they are not pouncing on anchored knights, and if a knight finishes in the end zone, it is anchored.","Implementation Note: In the original game, a player is not allowed to make a compound move which does not complete all three stages (e.g. Charge, Pounce, and Finish).  In order to better accomodate a computer implementation of this game, that rule has been modified such that if a stage cannot be completed, the only move available is to remove the knight."],"category":"other","themes":[5,12,39],"variations":0}

So it cannot capture backwards as immediate move.","A Man steps diagonally forwards. It captures, by the short leap, in all diagonal directions. A King slides and captures in all diagonal directions over any distance. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A King may \"fly\" over empty squares (\"long King\").","A Man promotes to King at the last rank. If a Man makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square and can continue capturing, it does not promote. One must continue capturing as long as possible. It is mandatory to select the longest capturing line. Captured pieces are removed only after the move is finished. The goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces.","A variant features a halt rule is featured: a King must halt behind the last captured piece. This rule also occurs in Argentinian checkers (here). There is also a variant where it is not mandatory to capture the longest line.","The game is played on an 8x8 board with 12 pieces per player. Brazilian checkers (Minor Polish draughts), the forebear of this variant, was known already in the 16th century, and possibly even earlier. It was a popular board game in Holland, especially in Amsterdam.","Discussion","Most Western checkers variants belong to either of two groups, International/Polish or Spanish. In the former, a Man may capture backwards; in the latter only forwards. The problem with backwards capture is that the defence becomes easy. Although a Man advances, it retains control of squares in the rear. The problem with the Spanish group is that it has less combinatorial complexity, due to less capture directions.","Stockholm checkers keeps the advantages of both. Although A Man can also capture backwards, it may only do this later, as part of a series. It means that the defence becomes more difficult. A Man may sneak behind the back of an enemy Man and reach a promotion square. This vouches for a less drawish game. Moreover, the advanced and interesting combinatorial aspects of International/Polish variants are retained. Arguably, the introduction of the deferred backwards capture rule is a significant improvement. Worse endgames will become more difficult to hold. Although this variant is an invention of undersigned, the rule already exists in a traditional Gothic (orthogonal) checkers variant (\"Armenian checkers II\"), where a Man may not capture southwards as immediate move. However, here the strategical impact of the rule is less pronounced.","See also:","Winther, M. (2015). \"International/Polish Checkers Variants\".

The Rebels can only move in the direction of the Privy (triangle), or up and down. The General can move in all directions, but may also remain on the same square, provided that he is surrounded (he can then make a static capture). The object for the Rebels is to drive the General to the Privy and force him to the apex, in which case the Rebels win. Rebels may not capture. The object for the General is to get behind the Rebels, in which case he shall be regarded the winner (reaching the bottom of the board is the only win-condition). The General captures by two methods (1) static intervention: the General remains in place and removes two enemy stones that surround him, either vertically or horisontally (to make this capture, simply lift and drop the General). This capture can only be executed when the General is wholly surrounded and lacks freedoms, as in the initial position. Also a cornered General can capture by static intervention (2) deferred intervention: the General captures the pieces perpendicular to the movement direction, as he moves away. Press the start button to start the game.","The Rebels should approach the General in an effort to drive him into the Privy. In order to achieve this the Rebels must be prepared to sacrifice pieces. My Zillions program does not play well with the Rebels, but it doesn't matter since the Rebels should be handled by the human player, as it is much more challenging. With these rules, it is a surprisingly good and well-balanced hunt game. A simpler alternative is to allow the Rebels to move in all directions, which is also a good game, although it makes the Rebel's task simpler. In this case, the General wins by capturing a sufficient number of Rebels, so that only eight Rebels remain, for instance. The win-condition is different, while the game isn't constantly progressing.","Subjugatio Rebellium is described in Thomas Hyde's seventeenth century book. The rules, written in Latin, have been interpreted by Robert Reid. The deferred intervention capture is a suggestion of mine. In his book, Hyde clearly defines the static intervention capture. Evidently, deferred intervention capture is related to the static version. It's the same pieces that are captured, namely those that surround the General where it is positioned. So it is very likely that this is the type of capture that he meant, rather than normal intervention capture. In both cases it is the \"from\" square which defines which pieces are to be captured. Thus, the General can only capture pieces by being between them, not going between them. The rule of deferred intervention capture is substantiated by the fact that we are told that the General 'semper facit' (\"always does so\" - captures, i.e.). In this sense, capture is compulsory as it is automatic, but not in the sense of modern checkers.","Alternative variant: In this difficult (but probably not authentic) variant, static intervention capture can be executed also when the General is not surrounded. Normal intervention capture is here used (pieces surrounding the \"to\" square are captured). The object for the Rebels is to drive the General to the Privy (triangle) or to stalemate the General in a corner. The Rebels win if the entrance to the Privy is closed while the General is inside. Rebels may not capture and may not enter the Privy. The object for the General is to capture enough Rebels so they can't force him into the Privy. The General wins if there are only 8 Rebels left or the General manages to reach the bottom of the board (opposite to the Privy). The General captures by intervention, stepping beside two stones, either horisontally or vertically, in which case both stones are removed. The General may also remain in place provided that he can remove two enemy pieces that surround him, either vertically or horisontally (to make this capture, simply lift and drop the General). Capture moves are mandatory. Note that in this variant the Rebels can also win by stalemating the General in a corner at the right side of the board.","References  Reid, R.

This game has been mainly designed for human playing against human. The Zillions machine has very little understanding of the game.   You play as Red against Blue. Click the main board. One card will be dropped by the system onto the center of the main board, and seven cards will be dropped on each player's rack. There are 81 cards altogether, and each player can place 40 of these cards.   A player's move consists of moving one card from the rack to the main board. The card has to be placed next to an existing card.   The placed card can match the neigbouring card in the following ways:  - it may have the same frame colour  - it may have the same butterfly shape  - it may have the same colour of the butterfly (red, blue or yellow)  - it may have the same orientation (direction the butterfly is flying to) In variants 1 and 2 you always need two such common properties with each neighbour; in variants 3 and 4 (childen's variants) you only need one such common properties with each neighbour.   If you can place a card next to at least two neighbours, you have another free turn. Please note that you cannot pass this additional turn if you still have cards to play!   The player who has used his/her 40 cards first is the winner. Counters on the left and right border show you how many cards you still have to place. Because of the conditions put on the moves, usually the board will not fill up completely and the game will be over before a player has placed 40 cards.   You cannot pass a move in this game. If you cannot make a 'good' move then you have to make a 'bad' move and the system will declare your opponent to be the winner. This basically means that stalemate is a loss.

The original game is described in Sid Sackson's book, a Gamut of Games. It states that the game was designed by Henry Busch \u0026 Arthur Jaeger. No further details are given. I have also seen the same game under the name of Cats \u0026 Dogs and Wild West.   Object:The object of the game is achieved by moving the Captain to the red dot, by moving it along the black line that runs throughout the board. Each player's Captain follows a different path to reach the red dot. This red dot space may only be occupied with a captain piece. No other piece may move onto it.  In some variants, you can also win the game, if you move your captain 3 spaces further along the track than your opponent. This variant is active whenever a regular Captain is used, as opposed to the Turbo Captain.   Order of play:Players alternate turns moving one of their pieces. Pieces move as described in the next section. Capturing is manditory, and is done by jumping vertically and/or horizontally. Multiple jumps are possible.  Pieces (names and how they move):","Captain (a circle with a + on it): This is the main piece of the player. It may not capture or be captured. It moves along the heavy black line one space towards the red dot in the middle of the board. The captain can't be capture or captured. If the next space is occupied by a piece, the captain can't move.","Turbo Captain (a circle with a star on it): This is similar to a regular captain but has extra mobility. This piece moves along the black line until it it can't move due to a piece blocking a space or it reaches the red spot (and wins the game).","Private (plain circle): This piece is similar to a non-king Turkish checker. It may move one space left or right or one space forward, but not along the path the captain piece moves on. When a Private reaches the back row of the opponent, it is promoted (just like in regular checkers). The Private piece is promoted to a Sargeant.","Sargeant (a circle with a dot on it): This piece move 1 position in any direction along any line including heavy line. They can't enter the red dot. Guards capture by jumping like in checkers. Multiple jumps are allowed. Capturing is mandatory.  Description of variants:In this game, there are multiple variants of different types:","Turbo Captain variants: This variant starts the players with a turbo captian, rather than a regular captain piece.","Super variants: This variant starts the players with Private pieces rather than sargeant pieces.","Classic variants: This variant starts the players with Sargeant pieces rather than private pieces.","3 space difference = win variants: This variant is only used in games where a regular Captain piece is used. If a player advances their Captain piece 3 spaces further along to the red spot in the center of the board, that player wins. This rule was originally in Roger Cooper's design and was kept to assist the play of the AI in the game. This rule was excluded from the Turbo Captain variants due to game balancing issues.","Light variants: The players play with half the normal pieces. This makes for a shorter game.","POW variants: This variant starts the players with their captain trapped behind enemy lines. The objective is the same as in regulard Blue and Gray, but the game plays out differently.  Designer Notes:I had seen Blue and Gray in Sid Sackson's book and it piqued my interest. When I had seen it, I had thought mixing checkers in with it would be a nature. I played it a few times and it worked. When I adapted my version of the game to Zillions, the idea of the Turbo Captain came about. With this came the POW variant idea. I also threw in a light variant, to make for a quicker game."],"image":"game819_scr_SuperBlueGray.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":12}

Troyka","created":"2001-08-04","description":["Superstring is the latest installment in the \"nD\" game series, a collection of games designed to explore the unique environment of n-space. These games, including to date Wormhole, Hyperspace, and Skava, are characterized by simple rule sets that allow the player to focus on the interconnections of \"hyperboards.\"  Superstring is unique among the nD games in that it is cross-dimensional, meaning that its rule set works in space of arbitrary dimensions. The rules are:  The players take turns placing two pieces on the board.  Each piece must be placed orthogonally adjacent to the last piece played by that player.  Win by stalemating your opponent.  Black opens the game by placing only one piece.  The paths created by placing pieces in orthogonal series are called \"superstrings.\" A superstring snakes through n-space until entering a space surrounded on all sides, from which it cannot emerge. The first player so stalemated loses the game. There are only two superstrings in any game, yours and the opponent's, and strategy consists of forcing the opponent into portions of the board with limited space. If the board is completely filled, a draw is declared.  Superstring is presented in this rules file in 3D, 4D, 5D, and 6D, with the more intuitive 3D version the default. A description of the hyperboards is included in the strategy section for each variant. The game has also been implemented for 2D, hex, toroidal, and 7D boards.  The 3D boards are ideal for learning to think spatially. A superstring follows simple orthogonal paths along all three axes, and the players can focus on how those paths fill up the \"box.\" The stalemate concept also helps players understand the construction of the hyperboards. Because a superstring terminates only in spaces surrounded on all orthogonal sides, a player must quickly learn to identify how spaces are connected along the multiple axes.  N-space has long been familiar to mathematicians and physicists. As strange as the concept seems, contemporary string theory in physics, now widely accepted as the most promising path toward a unified field theory (the so-called \"Theory of Everything\"), holds that there are nine spatial dimensions (or even ten!) in the universe, at least at the particle level. The nD series offers a glimpse of these extra degrees of freedom.  Please send any comments or bug reports to dtroyka@justice.com.

Orthogonal capture is deferred -- neither Man nor Dame can make an immediate orthogonal capture. They may, however, capture orthogonally subsequently; as part of a capture sequence. It is played on an 10x10 board with 20 pieces per player.","A Man steps diagonally forwards. It captures only in the forward or sideway directions. Thus, it may also capture west, east and north, but only during a jump sequence (\"deferred capture freedom\"). As immediate move, it may only capture diagonally forward. It lands on the next square behind the captured piece. When capturing orthogonally, it jumps to a square of equal colour.","A Dame slides and captures diagonally. It may also capture in the orthogonal directions, but only during a jump sequence. It jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A Dame may \"fly\" over empty squares (\"long Dame\"). The Dame must halt behind the last captured piece. This brings the advantage that it is more predictable. Despite this it remains powerful, thanks to the many capture freedoms. This halt rule is known from several traditional checkers variants.","A Man promotes to Dame at the last rank. If a Man makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square and can continue capturing sideways, it does not promote. One must continue capturing as long as possible. It is mandatory to select the longest capturing line. Captured pieces are removed only after the move is finished. The goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces. Two Dames are sufficient for a win against a lone Dame. This game is also suitable for playing on an 8x8 board (\"Swedish Checkers\" 8x8).","History","This is not a traditional variant, but an invention of undersigned. However, it has a forbear in a Frisian variant played in the 18th and 19th century (\"Markvärn\"). Around 1750 Lars (Lorentz) Mollberg (1734-1772) visited his relatives in Amsterdam, from where he brought the game back to Stockholm. Carl Michael Bellman (1740-95; famous Swedish writer and lyric poet) mentions it in a poem from 1783, about the \"marquern\"-playing corporal Mollberg. The game seems to have survived for a time in Stockholm, as Carl Johan Billberg mentions the game in his game book from 1838-39.","Strategy","Notice that this game introduces many new combinatorial aspects compared with Spanish checkers, yet is not overmuch complicated. Although a Man can also capture orthogonally, it may only do this later, as part of a series. By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage generally leads to a win. A good strategy is to try and get the first Dame, because this piece will cause a lot of damage to the opponent, provided he cannot capture the Dame quickly. Try to hinder the opponent from getting a Dame, by keeping your lines closed so that he cannot break through. Pieces that are moved forward too much are fragile. Since a Man cannot capture backwards as immediate move, a good idea is to keep a Man or two as rear guards. Rule of thumb: try to keep your side organized in effective blocks, instead of spreading them out in many isolated pieces."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":4}

A player has won when there are THREE checkers of his colour in a row, either horizontally or vertically or diagonally. The two players Red and Black move in turn. In principle the moves are made like in Vertical_TicTacToe. However, you are not free in your choice. Instead, the opponent forbids all your moves except for two. These two remaining candidates are marked by crosses in your colour.  You click that cross you want to realize; and you have to click the other cross twice to make it disappear. After this you place the two candidates for your opponent. Red starts the game by placing two crosses for Black.  A complete turn consists of ten single actions: (1) Cross 1    (2) Cross 2    (3) Black Checker    (4 \u0026 5) Delete remaining Cross    (6) Cross 1    (7) Cross 2    (8) Red Checker    (9 \u0026 10) Delete remaining Cross.  Therefore it is recommended to play 'This or That' on smaller boards and not on the typical 7x6-grid of Connect4.  The many single actions in a turn also mean that the Zillions engine has to search to something like depth 40 to detect a 'win in 5'. The picture below shows a situation where player Black has just placed the two candidates for his opponent. At search depth 42 Zillions has found that this is a 'Win in 5' for Black.

One face has two arcs, Black and White, each drawn as  to join two sides of the tile which share a common corner.  The  other face has two straight lines, Black and White, drawn as to  join opposite sides of the tile.   Each player takes turns placing tile upon the field.  After the  first placed tile, all subsequent tiles must be played so that at  least one side is adjacent to another tile.  Sides of adjacent tiles  must align so that the colors of the connecting 'tracks' match.   The initial tile played on each player's turn is called the 'primary'.   If an empty cell on the playing field has two adjacent tile whose  sides present the same color of connection, the player must play an  appropriate tile to this cell.  This is called a 'forced move' and is  mandatory.  A forced move can result in consecutive forced moves.   If a move result in an empty cell which has three or more adjacent  tiles whose sides present the same color of connection, the primary  tile of that turn and any forced move tiles must be retracted, and  the player must attempt an alternate move.   The winner is the first player to form either a loop or line of their  color.  A loop is a closed path of any shape.  A line is a path which  joins opposite and outermost edges of the played tiles over at least  eight cells, across or down.  A player may actually win by an opponent's  move.  If winning formations result for both Black and White are  completed in the same turn, the player who preformed the moves is the winner.   Trax is an infinite game. It can be played with an infinite number of  tiles upon an infinite surface.  But for the purpose of this implementation,  it has been restricted to a 21x21 field with only 128 tiles.  This would be  similar to playing the game on a card table with two sets.   The first tile of the game must be played to the marked cell in the middle  of the field.  In order to retract moves, the player uses as necessary the  Back Up One Move button on the toolbar.  Drop a tile upon the field by  clicking on the desired space, the diagrams to the right of the field are  for the purpose of reference.    Trax was invented by New Zealander David Smith in 1980.

Such a momentarily invulnerable Man is called \"vanguard\". In any other situation, it is allowable to capture backwards. Note that a King cannot become a vanguard, so a King is not invulnerable in this situation.","Although a Man can also capture backwards, it may not immediately capture a vanguard. It means that it is trickier to defend against intruders. A Man may sneak behind the back of an enemy Man and capture it from behind, or reach a promotion square. Arguably, it is a good idea to keep a Man or two as rear guards. However, the rule could also be used to attack a vanguard, since it cannot immediately capture a Man that attacks from behind. In International Draughts, it is difficult to win with three Kings against one. Diverse halt rules have been proposed as a remedy. The vanguard rule is preferably combined with any of four different halt rules (cf. Winther, 2017a, here)","Piece movement","A Man steps diagonally forwards.

In the beginning the board is empty and the stones are put in reach for both players. The players choose their colors. Light makes the first move, then players take turns.","Play","In each turn a player must try to enter a stone (with his own color facing up) on an empty space. If a stone is placed such that exactly one opponent stone is orthogonally or diagonally between the entered stone and another friendly stone, then this opponent stone is flipped and becomes a friendly stone. This is called a capture. Now the entered stone must be used as the starting point to capture another opponent stone and so on until no further capture is available. Capturing is not mandatory, but if a capture move is made, any capture moves which follow must be made, too. It is not necessary to always follow the path where a maximum of captures is possible. A capture move is similar to a capture move in Checkers. It is like jumping over one opponent stone, but here no stone is moved and a captured stone is not removed (it is flipped instead). Instead of capturing, a player can enter a single stone on an arbitrary empty space. However, it is not allowed to enter a stone (orthogonally or diagonally) next to a friendly stone if there isn't also an opponent stone adjacent to that new stone. Lastly, stones may only be entered on corner spaces if there is another (opponent) stone (orthogonally or diagonally) adjacent. If a player cannot make a capture and cannot enter a stone, he must pass. The other player will always have a move available.","End of the Game","The game ends when the board is completely filled.

It is known by a variety of regional names, including Awari, Oware, Awale, Woro, and Ayo, and it is played throughout Africa and the West Indies. The rules are as follows:  The board is divided into twelve holes and two stores. One player plays from the bottom six holes and the other plays from the top six. The stores are used for storing captured pieces -- called beans -- and do not play a role in the game. The right store is for the bottom player and the left store for the top player.  The game begins with four beans in each of the twelve holes. The bottom player goes first. A move is made by picking up the beans in a player's hole and sowing them one at a time counterclockwise around the board. Sowing begins with the hole immediately after the lift hole and continues until all the beans have been dropped. If twelve or more beans are sown, the lift hole is skipped over and remains empty at the end of the turn.  If the last piece dropped by a player lands in an opponent hole that contains two or three beans (including any dropped beans), those beans are captured and placed in the player's store. If the captured hole is preceded by an unbroken chain of one or more enemy holes containing two or three beans, those beans are also captured.  If all of the opponent's holes are empty, you must make a move that gives at least one bean to the opponent, unless no other move is available. If you make a move that would normally capture all opponent beans, no captures result.  The game ends when a player captures twenty-five beans or when a player has no move because all of that player's holes are empty. In the latter case, all remaining pieces are awarded to the opponent. If it is your turn to move and you have no beans, you must click on an empty hole to award the remaining beans to the opponent. The winner is the player with the most captured beans at the end of the game.  For a generic game engine, Zillions plays Wari remarkably well.

Pieces move one space in any direction except that a piece in its home zone (shaded) cannot move diagonally.  Oddly enough, Zonesh was conceived as a 2D variant of the 5D game Skava. The rules are the same except for the ability of pieces in Zonesh to move diagonally once outside of their home zones. This rule compensates for the reduced freedom of a 2D board and makes draws virtually impossible.  Zonesh, along with Skava, Breakthrough, and Sidewinder, belongs to a limited class of attainment games characterized by undifferentiated pieces. Declaring a win-zone on a board permits an extraordinary simplification of rules without loss of depth.  Zonesh comes in 5x5 and 6x6 versions."],"category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":2}

You can not step to this square. Yours aim is stalemated opponent. Remember - the blockade is working against to Persians, too.","Inspired by famous myth. In the Battle of Thermopylae, which occurred in August 480 BC[1] (and was detailed almost entirely by Herodotus), an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian Empire at the pass of Thermopylae in central Greece. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the Persians for three days in one of history's most famous last stands. A small force led by King Leonidas I of Sparta blocked the only road through which the massive army of Xerxes I of Persia could pass. After three days of battle, a local resident named Ephialtes is believed to have betrayed the Greeks by revealing a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King Leonidas stayed behind with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespian volunteers, 400 Thebans who may have been pressed into service, and 900 Helots.","The Persians succeeded in taking the pass but sustained losses disproportionate to those of the Greeks. The fierce resistance of the Spartan-led army offered Athens the invaluable time to prepare for a decisive naval battle that would determine the outcome of the war. The subsequent Greek victory at the Battle of Salamis left much of the Persian Empire's navy destroyed and Xerxes retreated to Asia, leaving a force in Greece under Mardonius, who was to complete the subjugation of the Greeks. The Spartans assembled at full strength and led a pan-Greek army that defeated the main Persian force at the Battle of Plataea. This battle ended the Greco-Persian War and the expansion of the Persian Empire into Europe.","Both ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the superior power of a patriotic army of freemen defending native soil. The performance of the defenders at the battle of Thermopylae is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers, and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds."],"image":"game1639_scr_300_Spartans.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12,37],"variations":2}
