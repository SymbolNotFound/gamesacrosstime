'Aperiodic Tilings' uses more or less the same functions (apart from the copy functions). Hence only the copy functions will be explained here again.","It is very easy to create aperiodic (i.e. non-repetitive) tilings from self-similar polygons. This is the method we use here and this is also the method which the famous 'Pinwheel Tiling' uses; see history text for details. The method creates patterns which are on the line between order and chaos. This makes them visually pleasing.","As you can see on the board, we start off with a simple shape, in this case a domino, which can be tiled by smaller copies of itself. These smaller copies have all the same size in this case, but this is not necessary in general.","The second drawing shows a domino twice the size of the first, and tiled with 4 smaller copies of the first. The third drawing shows a domino twice the size of the second, and tiled with 4 copies of the second.If we produce bigger and bigger dominoes this way, we will cover bigger and bigger areas. The resulting covering of the plane will be indeed aperiodic. We make this more visible by colouring the second domino with 4 different colours and keeping these colours when we make copies of diagram 2.","Your task is to try to repeat the suggested process until the given 50x50 board is fully covered.The four templates shown at the right border help you with this. Using them you can draw a 2x4 template made from four dominoes with each click.The HOTSPOT option allows you to change the location of the handle on the template. For some variants the hotspot is fixed.","The solution (select Help/ShowSolution) will show you what your result should look like.Depending on into which direction you enlarge the domino with each step, the outcome will look slightly different. When you have covered a large area this way, click 'delete all outlines', then click 'add all outlines' to create some interesting patterns.It also pays sometimes to make 2 or 3 colours the same first (use button 'exchange colours').","Variants: In some variants (such as variant 3) one has to alternate between two dissection methods with each 'generation' of enlargement in order to obtain a aperiodic pattern.","There is also a FREEPLAY variant with an empty board.","The most famous aperiodic tilings of the plane are most probably :","the 'Pinwheel Tiling' attributed to Charles Radin, featured on the Melbourne Federation Square Buildings (http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/texture/pinwheel/).

It is derived from a right triangle with sides 1 and 2 tiled by five smaller copies of itself.","Roger Penrose's quasi-crystals with near-fivefold symmetry. If all the smaller copies have same size, the polygon is called a 'reptile' (from repetition tiling). If the smaller copies have different sizes, the polygon is called an 'irreptile'. Each reptile is also an irreptile. Irreptiles which are not reptiles are called 'puritiles'. The terms 'irreptile' and 'puritile' were introduced in my book 'A Puzzling Journey To The Reptiles And Related Animals' (available from http://karl.kiwi.gen.nz/), which researches deeply in these topics."],"image":"game1080_scr_Aperiodic_Tilings.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[9,11],"variations":6}

(Several customizable variants for each of the options.) The selection screen offers you a choice of 12 polysquares. Select a polysquare to start the corresponding game. You will be shown a playing area that the computer will try to fill.  To start, click the playing area. Zillions will AUTOMATICALLY tile the area without gaps or overlaps using copies of the given polysquare. YOU CAN GIVE THE COMPUTER ANY SHAPE MADE FROM SQUARES.(You can REDESIGN the fill-area very quickly and easily, either by deleting or adding new positions via selecting 'empty' or 'T0' with your right mouse button or by changing the board setup in the rules file.)  THE PROGRAM WILL DO EVERYTHING ELSE FULLY AUTOMATICALLY! Given a shape and a tile to fill it with, in general it is not known whether such a tiling problem has a solution. 'Backtrack' gives you the answers and lets you watch as the computer plays with the tiles.  The game demonstrates tree search by backtracking.You can invent new puzzles all the time and - best of all - let Zillions solve them automatically and in front of your eyes. If it cannot place a tile, the program tries to rearrange the tile previously placed and so on.There is even some 'intelligence' build in. E.g., if the computer finds an isolated unoccupied square anywhereon the board, it will backtrack and try other possibilities for placing a tile.Furthermore, some options have tile-specific optimisation routines built in, which have the effect that not all possible orientations will actually be tried out.Such optimisations can be very easily created for any tile.(If you change to code to improve it, remember that this zrf is designed for ANY given shape to be filled, not only for rectangles!)  The system will stop (win) when it has found a tiling, and also stop (lose) if there is no tiling for the given shape.  Please note that most options have several variants.Also note that there are three alternative piece sets available.You can speed up the game by switching the sound off.  The backtracking method is an essential tool for systematically solving tiling puzzles and many other problems. The search path on the board is also important.This game 'Backtrack' uses a meandering path, filling one file from top to bottom, the next file from bottom to top and so on.

Each player begins with a Heart-tile face down in the center of the playing area. The rest of the 120 tiles begin in an off-screen reservoir managed by the computer dealer. The front of each tile is divided into 2 squares. The Heart-tile is divided into a Face-square and Heart-square. The other tiles are divided into Base-squares (distinguished by color -- Red, Yellow, Green, Blue) and Class-squares (Cross, Skull, Attacker, or Star). The significance of these squares will be explained later. The back of each tile (colored black) is considered Void and is not divided into squares. The significance of Void and Non-void will be explained later.","Botany is a turn-based game, with each turn divided into three phases indicated by colored letters which appear at the top center of the game board. The green circle symbol at the bottom of the screen is the button which starts a game. The red stop-sign symbol which replaces it is a button which ends the current phase and begins the next.","The first phase is the Void Phase (indicated by a green 'V'). During this phase the player may void tiles which are in play. If a player's Heart-tile is voided, it is unvoided at the start of this phase (the Heart-tile is the only tile which unvoids). At the start of the game the first player's Heart-tile unvoids and the computer dealer deals 5 tiles into the space at the bottom of the screen representing the player's 'hand'. If the Void-phase begins with the Heart-tile unvoided the computer deals one tile. Since there are no tiles in play except the Heart-tile at the start of the game, the first player can only void the Heart-tile (which would result in the discard of the 'hand' tiles) or pass to the next phase. The advantage of voiding tiles is that doing so often makes the tile harder to destroy (see Attack Phase below), eliminates potential connection conflicts (see Play Phase below), or -- in the case of Cross-tiles -- grants an extra tile draw. The disadvantage is that voided tiles cannot form connections with other tiles (see Play-phase below) and can only remain in play while adjacent to at least one Non-void square.","The second phase is the Attack Phase (indicated by a yellow 'A'). During this phase the player may perform an attack on the other player using attack-capable tiles in play. As mentioned before, tiles are organized into classes and certain classes -- Skull, Attacker, Star -- have the ability to perform attacks. An attack is performed by detaching an attack-capable tile in play and repositioning it adjacent to the desired target tile(s) on the opposing player's side of the board. Only one attack may be performed per Attack Phase but there is no limit to the number of eligible tiles which may participate. Eligible tiles are attack-capable tiles which are in play at the start of the Attack Phase. The result of an attack depends on the offensive properties of the attacking tiles and the defensive properties of the targeted tiles. All 3 exposed sides of a Star-tile will destroy targeted Non-void squares (and associated tiles). The exposed tip of an Attacker-tile will destroy targeted Void or Non-void squares (and associated tiles), while the remaining 2 exposed sides will destroy targeted Non-void squares  (and associated tiles). All 3 exposed sides of a Skull-tile will destroy targeted Void and Non-void squares (and associated tiles). Voided tiles, the 2 sides of the Attacker-square, all 3 exposed sides of the Star-square, and all 3 exposed sides of a Face-square are considered Void for defensive purposes. (The exception with the Face-square is that a player may 'deflect' an attack by discarding a tile in hand). Attacking tiles are deployed by first clicking the desired tile and dragging it into the 'roundabout' located at the bottom of the screen (the 'X' with radiating arrows). When the attacking tile is properly re-oriented, the player clicks the square adjacent to the desired target tile(s) on the opponent's side of the board. After all of the attacking tiles have been positioned, the attacks are resolved in any order, as if they occured simultaneously. All destroyed and attacking tiles are discarded. A player may use the Heart-tile in an attack if there are no tiles attached to it. It functions as a Star-tile and returns to its 'home' position after the attack. During the Attack Phase the player may also detach and discard any unwanted tiles in play.","The third phase is the Play Phase (indicated by a red 'P'). During this phase the player may take tiles in 'hand' and put them into play. The rule for putting tiles into play is that their Base-square must lie adjacent to a white Class-square (Heart-square or Cross-square) or same-colored Base-square already in play. Different colored Base-squares may not lie adjacent. Tiles are put into play using the same drag-and-drop method used in the Attack Phase. The end of the Play Phase marks the end of the player's turn and the start of the opponent's Void Phase etc. Play continues until the capture of one of the Heart-tiles."],"image":"game982_scr_Botany.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[1,11],"variations":0}

Digits are used instead of colours. The computer chooses a pattern of four digits. In the standard variant it uses digits 1-6. Duplicates are allowed, so the computer could even choose the same four code digits. To invoke a random hidden code, press 'Start Thinking'. The chosen pattern is placed upmost but hidden to the player. If you give up and want to view the code, press 'Switch Piece Set'.","The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and correct digit, within nine turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code digits on the decoding board. Once placed, the computer provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs at the sideboard. A black key peg is placed for each code digit from the guess which is correct in both digit and position; a white peg indicates the existence of a correct digit placed in the wrong position. The black pegs are always placed leftmost, so there is no correlation of position. Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or nine incorrect guesses are made. If you can keep an average of five or below in the standard variant, then you are good. An inexperienced player can begin at the easiest level where only digits 1-4 are used in the code. You should turn off 'Moves List' in order not to cheat inadverdently .","Mastermind or Master Mind is a simple code-breaking board game for two players, invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. A similar pencil and paper game, called bulls and cows, was played at least as far back as the early 1960's (Wikipedia).","With 4 positions and 6 digits, there are 64 = 1296 different patterns. In 1977, Donald Knuth demonstrated that an algoritm can solve the pattern in five moves or fewer, using an algorithm that progressively reduces the number of possible patterns (Wikipedia)."],"image":"game1574_scr_Codebreaker.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[36,11],"variations":5}

Digits are used instead of colours. The computer chooses a pattern of five digits. In the standard variant it uses digits 1-6. Duplicates are allowed, so the computer could even choose the same five digits. To invoke a random hidden code, press 'Start Thinking'. The chosen pattern is placed upmost but hidden to the player. If you give up and want to view the code, press 'Switch Piece Set'.","The codebreaker must try to guess the pattern, in both order and correct digit, within nine turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code digits on the decoding board (just press on a square in the lowermost row). Once placed, the program provides feedback by placing from zero to five key pegs at the sideboard. A black key peg is placed for each digit from the guess which is correct in both digit and position. A white peg indicates that a correct digit is placed in the wrong position. The black pegs are always placed leftmost, so there is no correlation of position. Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or nine incorrect guesses are made. An inexperienced player can begin at the easiest level where only digits 1-5 are used in the code. You should turn off 'Moves List' in order not to cheat inadverdently .","Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking board game for two players, invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. A similar pencil and paper game, called bulls and cows, was played at least as far back as the early 1960's (Wikipedia). With 5 positions and 6 digits, there are 65 = 7776 different patterns. You can try out different solutions by placing a digit on the board. As long as you haven't placed all five of them, you can retract the digit. The standard version, with variants, has also been implemented (see Codebreaker).","See also my homepage."],"image":"game2065_scr_ExpertCodebreaker.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[36,11],"variations":2}

(28 fixed and 16 randomized setups)   You can move a piece as many places as there are pieces on this line (line = row, column or diagonal). If you land on a piece, it will be captured. Two deletion rules apply:   Square-Deletion Rule: If the target position contains a ball which is part of any 4-balls-in-a-square arrangement, then all 4 balls will be deleted. (Example: balls on a1, a3, c1, c3, or balls on a1, a9, i1, i9). Note that the ball being moved cannot be part of such a arrangement if the 4-balls-in-a-square arrangement is to be deleted.

Diamond-Deletion Rule: This rule is similar to the Square-Deletion Rule, but here the squares tilted by 45 degrees. (Example: balls on a2, b1, b3, c2 or balls on a3, c1, c5, e3).   Both rules apply in all variants of this game.   To make the solutions more difficult, after every second move a ball will be dropped randomly, but adjacent to an existing ball.

Hence for each shape that is 'rectifiable' (i.e. which can tile a rectangle), it is an interesting task to find all prime rectangles ('primes') for this tile. For any given tile there can only be a finite number of such rectangles. For the G-hexomino we present here all known prime rectangles small enough to fit onto our board of size 32x32.  The G-hexomino is represented by six square tokens. The system will automatically change the colour of the tokens after you have put down a tile.  The system helps you to place a tile: Place two squares side by side, then a third orthogonally next to the second. The system will drop the remaining two squares automatically.  You can DELETE a placed hexomino by simply clicking the three squares which you placed on the board when you created the tile.  You win if you manage to fill the given rectangle.  This game presents the COMPLETE COLLECTION of all existing G-primes:18 of those fit on the 32x32 board and8 of those fit on the 52x50 board.  Please note that there are six alternative piece sets available.   Sources: Torsten Sillke, Michael Reid.

{"zrfID":1198,"id":"i-ching","name":"I Ching ","programmerID":380,"programmer":"Mats Winther","created":"2006-03-11","description":["This is not a game. It is the ancient Chinese divinatory system of 'I Ching', or 'Book of Changes'. The origin of the I Ching hexagrams date back more than 3000 years. Originally, during the Shang dynasty, the soothsayers used bones that were thrown into the fire. From cracks in the bones they were able to forecast the future. The broken and whole cracks are extant in I Ching as the whole lines (Yang), and the broken lines (Yin).","To question the oracle you must throw the long dice six times. These dice have only two numbers: two and three. To throw the dice, click on the upmost die. If the Yin numbers (the twos) are in majority then a Yin line (broken) will be produced. If the Yang numbers (the threes) are in majority, then a Yang line (whole) will be produced. Six throws are necessary to determine a hexagram. A number pops up, which is the number of the I Ching hexagram. To read what it has to say, right-click on the number and choose \"Properties\". A hexagram consist of two trigrams. The headings \"Above\" and \"Below\" reflect upon these. Under the heading \"The Lines\" you can read what the strong lines mean. A strong Yin line (a \"Six\") has a cross on it. A strong Yang line (a \"Nine\") has a circle on it. To question the oracle again, click on \"New game\".","Under the hexagram number there appears a 'C'. Right-click on it and you can read the comments of King Wan and Duke of Kau. Whereas the hexagram text derives from the Wilhelm translation, the comments are taken from the Legge translation. This is an ideal combination. The comments in the Wilhelm translation are somewhat prosaic, which is not suitable for this spiritual book. Remember that the hexagram is more important than the commentators' texts. It is your associations that count, that is, it is you who should write the comment. This is also Palmer/Ramsay's standpoint in 'I Ching - The Shamanic Oracle of Change' (1995).","I Ching contains much wisdom. It is well worth reading like a regular book. Its obscure language is typical for oracles (compare the oracle at Delphi, etc). Such obscure imagery can entice projections from the unconscious. It is well-known that the unconscious often carries solutions to our problems, as exemplified by the chemist Kekulé, who found the ring structure of benzene in a dream. A more prosaic explanation is that a comment of any sort has the capacity of breaking one's habitual thinking, and make one see things differently. Nigel Pennick, however, in \"Games of the Gods\", argues that any divinatory system reflects upon the state of the universe at this very moment. He builds this notion on C.G. Jung's concept of synchronicity. Be that as it may, divinatory systems do actually work, one way or another.","If you want to, you can edit the zrf-file, add comments, or insert improvements of the translation. There is much information on the I Ching to be found on the Internet. A curiosity is that G.W. Leibniz (1646-1716) read a Latin version of the I Ching. It was then that he got the idea of the binary system. The hexagrams are actually binary representations, if the broken lines are understood as 0 and the whole lines as 1. The binary system is what underlies the computer age. Thanks to this invention Leibniz was able to design a computer, but he was never able to fabricate it."],"image":"game1198_scr_I_Ching.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[9,11],"variations":0}

Altogether we had nine weeks available. To make the schedule most comfortable for the participants a flexible approach was tested: Before the start each team was allowed to nominate three weeks in which the team was not willing to play. The hope was that nevertheless a complete time table would be realizable. Indeed, things went well. The 2002 schedule was made by hand, and only recently the idea rose to design a Zillions scheduler for the task. In this Zillions realisation there are three actors:   (i) The ''User'' enters all the time-out wishes.   (ii) The ''Scheduler'' makes the schedule.   (iii) The ''Controller'' controls if the schedule is ok. The standard setting is that the Zillions engine has the role of Scheduler and Controller. However, Zillions is not a perfect Scheduler. So it makes sense to try interactive approaches. For instance, the human may create a partial starting schedule and let Zillions complete it.","There have been Jenazon Cups in 2001 and 2002. The event for 2003 will start in September. A Call for Participation may be found via the website  http://www.minet.uni-jena.de/jenazon.  Any teams from all over the world are welcome.

Here you have to create the wire-part of these puzzles from a small loop; the string has been omitted.Variants 6 - 14 : similar to variants 1 - 4, but the string (second loop) has to be attached as well. This makes the construction more difficult. (Note that in the actual wire puzzles the task is rather the opposite of the task given here; in the real puzzles you have to the string out without bending the wire. This task will be tackled by the game 'Knots 4'.)  There are also several freeplay-variants with a blank board: Variant 'Freeplay 1': one small loop given.Variant 'Freeplay 2': one piece of string given. Variant 'Freeplay 3': two pieces of string given. Variant 'Freeplay 4 (easy)': This is the most luxurious variant of Knots III. It is designed to create and manipulate knots very fast. Some features available in this variant are withheld from all other variants to make the puzzles more challenging. Extra features in Freeplay 4:- You can cut the string into any number of pieces (move straight onto adjacent straight).- You can turn upside a (top-layer or bottom-layer) self-intersecting string part simply by clicking the intersection.  The freeplay variants sometimes cause a 'too many moves generated' message. In these cases try to keep your string in a smaller area at first.  This game works best with SMART MOVES turned OFF!

In the drawing modes SQUARE/RECTANGLE/BOX/LINE/DOTTEDLINE/POLYLINE the chosen from-position, if not-empty, is highlighted in red colour.   When using POLYLINE, remember that you have to finish the polyline before you can select another mode. To finish a polyline, you either:  - click the red end piece of your polyline    This will paint the last missing segment in most cases, therefor strongly recommended.  - or click the POLYLINE button, which simply paints the red to-position black,    but which may leave the last graph piece undrawn. The POLYLINE concept has not been fully developed in this game, which the result that some automatically created corner pieces are placed in overwrite mode.   DECO-LINE fills a line with the selected icon.   Hint : Hit F7 regularly, e.g., to see where you can place the lower right corner of a square. Please note that there are eight pieceset/board combinations available!      'Linedraw' has been developed from the (now redundant) variant 2 of the Zillions game 'Draw'. Because of its greatly increased amount of code, versatility and imagery, as well of its changed focus, Linedraw is now a game on its own. It also has an increased board space of 30x30 position, and loads much faster.   Linedraw has quite a bit of 'intelligence' built in to make it work as expected, (when it tries not to overwrite existing graph, and for the polyline).

{"zrfID":1519,"id":"marquand-logic-machine","name":"Marquand Logic Machine ","programmerID":372,"programmer":"Greg Schmidt","created":"2007-12-15","description":["HISTORY:","In 1881, Princeton Professor Allan Marquand constructed a machine capable of solving simple problems in formal logic.  It was made from the wood of a red cedar post from Princeton's oldest homestead.  The machine displays all valid implications of a simple logical proposition by using an arrangement of rods, levers, catgut strings, and spiral springs.  Later, Marquand diagrammed an electrical circuit for his machine that became known as the first design for an electric logic machine.","THEORY:","In effect, the machine displays a truth table in accordance with the logical premises entered into it.  An interesting aspect of the machine is that the premises must be input in the negative form.  In this way, the machine eliminates any conclusions which contradict the premises.  The machine can handle up to four terms labeled A, B, C, \u0026 D.  The negation of these terms are represented by the corresponding lowercase letters a, b, c, \u0026 d.  The sixteen possible combinations of these four terms are represented by the sixteen rotating pointers.  The labeling on the top and right sides indicate the term associated with the pointer.  Starting from the top left and moving right, the terms are ABCD, AbCD, and aBcD.  The lower right corner corresponds to abcd.  A left pointing pointer indicates that the corresponding term is 'true', whereas a downward pointing pointer indicates 'false'. When the machine is reset, all pointers initially point left indicating that all terms start out being assumed true.","OPERATION:","There are ten keys near the bottom face of the machine.  Pressing the '1' key resets the machine by setting all pointers to 'true' (pointing left).  Each premise contains two terms, for example consider the premise 'A IMPLIES B'.  This can be restated in a negative form by saying that a true A cannot combine with a false B.  In other words, all combinations containing Ab must be eliminated.  This can easily be entered into the machine by first pressing A, then pressing b, followed by pressing the '0' key (the 'destruction' key).  Once this is done, all pointers corresponding to a term containing Ab will point down indicating that these terms are false.  This process is continued until all premises have been entered.  When complete, the final state of the pointers reflect the remaining combinations which are consistent with the premises.  The following example best illustrates this process.","EXAMPLE:","Marquand stated the following problem: Let us suppose there are four girls at school, Anna, Bertha, Cora, and Dora, and that someone had observed that: (1) Whenever either Anna or Bertha (or both) remained at home, Cora was at home; and (2) When Bertha was out, Anna was out; and (3) Whenever Cora was at home, Anna was at home. What information is conveyed here concerning Dora?","Let the A, B, C, \u0026 D terms stand for the four girls, where each term corresponds to the first letter of a girl's name. A capital letter indicates 'at home', a lowercase letter indicates the negation, 'not at home'.  Putting the above into logical form we have:","1. ( A OR B ) IMPLIES C 2. NOT B IMPLIES NOT A 3. C IMPLIES A","Putting these into the negative form using Marquand's notation yields:","1.1\tAc = 0 1.2\tBc = 0 2.\tbA = 0 3.\tCa = 0","After entering these premises into the machine, we examine the pointers to see what can be inferred about Dora.","The following left facing (true) pointers which include the D term are ABCD and abcD.  In other words, when Dora is at home, the other girls are either all at home or either all out.","Also the following left facing (true) pointers which include the d term are ABCd and abcd.  A similar conclusion can be drawn as before.  In other words, when Dora is out, the other girls are either all at home or either all out.","REFERENCES:","Logic Machines and Diagrams - Martin Gardner","http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/attic2/attic2_087.html","NOTE:","A stand-alone Axiom version is available, please email me for details (see included ReadMe.txt for address)."],"category":"solitaire","themes":[24,11,39],"variations":0}

The first 16 variants MAX-Solver are pure tiling problems. They do not require the MAX-game rule saying that only three colours are allowed and that adjacent tiles must differ in colour. In the second set of 16 variants, with the same shapes to be filled, MAX-Solver obeys this special MAX rule. In this second set you can select a special 'TURBO' mode to accelerate the search 10 times and more. However, in some cases the turbo mode may finish quickly and not find a solution at all when in fact there is one. But it is always worth trying out the turbo mode first.  The MAX pentiamond tile is represented here by five coloured dots. (This greatly reduces the complexity of the program; in the original MAX game the tiles where properly drawn as joined triangles.)  Given a shape and a set of tiles to fill it with, it is in general not known whether such a tiling problem has a solution. MAX-Solver allows you to try any given shape, and there are many discoveries still waiting to be made!  Select 'T0' with the right mouse button to add a dot to the board. Always choose the center of a triangle (corners are unused positions). Select 'empty' with the right mouse button to delete a position.  NOTE: you can speed up MAX-Solver by switching off the sound (menu option VIEW/OPTIONS/SOUND).   Due to the fact that in Zillions the number of possible moves is limited, MAX-Solver might not solve all given shapes. The larger the given shape, the more moves are necessary to find a solution.  Mathematically the MAX puzzle is interesting because the special 3-colour-rule uses only three colours, not the minimum of four colours that is normally required for colouring maps (compare 4-colour-theorem)!

For each pentomino type, you can determine whether the computer should use no tile, one tile or many (unlimited) tiles. Just click '0', '1' or 'M' for any of the twelve types displayed at the top.  Given a shape and a set of tiles to fill it with, it is in general not known whether such a tiling problem has a solution. (For example, which pentominoes or pairs of pentominoes tile the doughnut shape given in the default variant?) Pento-Solver allows you to try any combination of pentominoes for any given shape, and there are many discoveries still waiting to be made!  You can give the computer any shape made from squares. Select 'T0' with the right mouse button to add a square to the board.  Finally, click one of the two text bars to let the computer tile the given playing area automatically. The left button saying 'Fixed Colours' means that each pentomino type has its own, fixed colour. The right button saying 'Sequential Colours' means that the colour will change with each tile placed, the colours being from a series of 16 colours. This is especially useful when you use only very few types of tiles.  NOTE: YOU CAN SPEED UP PENTO-SOLVER THREEFOLD by switching off the sound (menu option VIEW/OPTIONS/SOUND).

Red and yellow mirrors change their orientation when hit.We will see that we can build all parts of a computer from these elements, and that in fact THE JUNCTION/SPLITTER ELEMENTS ARE THE ONLY ONES WE REALLY NEED! (See below and variants for details on this fact.)","The default variant shows how such a setup can be used to create a binary counter: The mirrors on red background represent the binary digit Zero, the mirrors on yellow background the binary digit One. Hit the run button to see how the setup counts in binary: 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101...

For more information read the game description of the variants.","The Photonworld presented here is a new system of elements which allows us to build all components of a computer. With ease we can build all logical gates and many other machines simply from fixed (!) mirrors, junctions and splitters.","The pair of flip-flop mirrors usually can be made redundant (for example for 8-cycle data) and be replaced by a more complicated setup of junction/splitter elements. This is demonstrated in some of the variants. The flip-flop mirrors are very convenient, however, to keep constructions simple. Moreover, all fixed mirrors can be replaced by junction/splitter elements (the construction may be have to be changed, though).","Blocks are redundant since a block can be constructed using a junction and three mirrors. Delays are necessary for odd types of data streams, because mirrors only allow delaying a data stream by an even number of ticks, which is sufficient for 2-, 4-, 6-cycle data etc.","The simplicity of the constructions is also helped by the fact that the photon data streams in this system can cross each other without interference (as long as they are kept out of step). Hence in Photonworld no special gadgetry is necessary to care for intersections, which is in stark contrast to many other systems.","If you find other interesting setups for this game, you can email them to me and I might include them in future versions of this game.","More freeware and real puzzles and games at my homepage: http://karl.kiwi.gen.nz."],"image":"game1003_scr_Photonworld.gif","category":"solitaire","themes":[24,11],"variations":49}

They can move freely over the empty spaces (light purple) but are (usually)  blocked by the walls. The walls come in 5 colors: red, blue, yellow, green,  and brown. The quanta cannot be moved individually, but can only by moved  simultaneously in a synchronized manner. The object of the puzzle is to make  all of the quanta disappear. (Note: the squares of the board are adjacent  orthogonally only. There is no diagonal movement.)","At the bottom of the board is a row of 14 buttons. You play the puzzle by  clicking on the buttons, not by moving the pieces. Click on one of the 4 light  blue buttons with arrows at the right end of the row to move all unblocked  quanta in the direction of the arrow. Quanta are blocked by walls and any  other blocked quanta, but not by moving quanta. This means that if one quantum  in a row of adjacent quanta can move, then all of the others will move with it  in sequence. Next in the button row (moving to the left) are 4 orange buttons  with arrows. Clicking on one of these will cause all of the quanta which are  blocked by a wall (only) to make a quantum jump over the wall, provided there  is an empty space on the other side, or another jumping quantum (but not a  stationary one). Again, this allows an entire sequence of quanta, separated by  walls, to jump together. Next are 2 purple buttons with double arrows. Clicking  on one of these causes every quantum which is adjacent to another quantum in the  given orientation (horizontal or vertical) to disappear. Finally, at the left end  of the row are 4 colored buttons (blue, red, yellow, green) with black X's.  Clicking on one of these causes all quanta which are adjacent to a wall of the  corresponding color to disappear. (The brown walls are inert.)","The most important rule of the puzzle is that each of the 10 leftmost buttons can  be clicked only once, after which it is blacked-out.

Troyka","description":["Rule 110 is a cellular automaton, similar to John Conway's Game of Life, which has been scripted by Karl Scherer (Alive and Alive_Auto), as well as by Robert Price (Game of Life). Rule 110 has recently gained attention as a result of a book written by Stephen Wolfram, known in mathematics circles as the author of the software program Mathematica. The book, called a New Kind of Science, suggests that both space and time can be modeled by cellular automata such that a relatively simple set of rules governing the content of a cell might lead to the actual complexity that we experience in the physical world. A cell in this case would be a discrete unit of space, itself spread into discrete units along a time axis, with rules governing its transition from one state to another based on the properties of neighboring cells.  As an example of how simple rules governing cellular automata can lead to complex structures, Wolfram analyzes the basic cellular automata created on a square grid when the rule governing the color of a square (white or black) depends solely on the colors of the three squares above to the northwest, north, and northeast. There are eight possible combinations of colors for these three squares. Because each of these combinations can be defined as causing the cell under consideration to be either white or black, there are a total of 256 (2 to the 8th) possible rules.  Most of these rules do not lead to interesting results. Rule 110, however, if applied to a sufficiently large graph, begins to generate complex irregular structures that do not appear to be predictable from the input row -- the top row of the graph -- or the rule governing coloring. Rule 110 states that a cell remains white if the three squares above are all white, all black, or black-white-white. Otherwise it is colored black. Wolfram purports to show that Rule 110 is a universal computer because it can emulate a universal Turing Machine. (The Turing Machine has also been coded by Karl Scherer). This means that any calculation capable of being performed by any mechanical method, i.e., on any computer, can be performed with Rule 110 using a suitably chosen input row and sufficiently long graph, with the output appearing in a designated bottom row.  This rules file allows you to run iterations of Rule 110, or any of the other 255 rules, with any chosen input row. The graphs come in sizes 10x10, 25x25, 50x50, 80x80, and 100x100. The larger graphs may take several seconds to load. This script departs from the technical definition of Rule 110 because the rows are considered to wrap around the horizontal edges. If you run the default setting once, you will get a technically correct Rule 110 graph through one iteration. For most rules and input rows, however, the first iteration will involve some wraparound effect. Subsequent iterations are always affected. The wraparound is a necessary compromise to make the graph presentable for a large number of rows. The graph also wraps around from bottom to top in successive iterations. This does not affect the accuracy of the rules but merely replaces older rows with newer ones.

The tricky part with these special T-intersections is - as with the other types of squares in SAILING (Left, Right, Forward, Backwards) - that they work in different ways depending from which direction you came from.  In contrast to the game SAILING, in the game SAILING II you can click on the boat to see where you are allowed to go.

The sailor Piet Hein is on heavy seas and you have to help him to get back home.  Before you play this game, it is recommended that you play Sailing II first.  The game Sailing III starts at the lower left square and ends at the top right square. The squares are colour-coded. The colours tell you where you go next (pushed by strong currents and heavy winds):","A dark red square (with an arrow pointing up) tells you to move straight ahead.","A purple square (with a left arrow) tells you to turn left (relative to where you came from).","A light green square (with a right arrow) tells you to turn right 4 (relative to where you came from).","A blue square (with a down arrow) tells you to turn straight back to where you came from.","A light red square is similar to a T-intersection: it tells you to turn left or right (relative to where you came from).The other colours work similarly. The little arrows help you along, but remember that they only show directions indirectly! You always have to watch where you came from.

The object is to move stones around a maze until they are all where they should be.  The challenge is to not make a wrong move and make your task impossible.  If you organize your task appropriately, you can accomplish it.  But if you slip up, it will become impossible to push every stone where it goes.","The name comes from the myth of Sisyphus, a king in Greek mythology who was condemned in Tartarus to roll a stone up a hill again and again.  Each time he got it to the top of the hill, it would roll down, and he would have to walk back down and push it up again.  In this game, Sisyphus has moved on to push stones around Sokoban style mazes.  When he finishes one maze, he has another to do.","Sokoban was invented in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, the president of THINKING RABBIT Inc. JAPAN.","Sisyphus comes with 25 original mazes, a solution for each maze, a variety of background images, a level editor ZRF (sisyphus-edit.zrf), a wall-pattern generating ZRF (sisyphus-auto.zrf), and a program (sokovert.exe) for converting between file formats.  This will turn the ZSG files from the level editor into ZRF code for playing the level, and it will turn ZSG files from sisyphus-auto.zrf into ZSG files that can be fed into the level editor.  It will also convert between other Sokoban maze formats, including the Bulldozer format and the popular XSokoban format.  So you can use the level editor to create mazes for other Sokoban programs or use sokovert to adapt mazes in other formats for Sisyphus.  Most of my mazes were created with the Bulldozer level editor, and the later ones were created with the Sisyphus level editor.  The very latest were based on patterns of walls randomly generated by sisyphus-auto.zrf.  All mazes were converted to ZRF format with the aid of sokovert.  The maze shown below was hand-designed with the level editor."],"category":"solitaire","themes":[6,11],"variations":25}

A Turing Machine is the most basic type of a computer. Input and output data are stored on the same linear storage, called a 'tape'. Along the tape a 'read/write head' is moving which reads, the writes one signal at a time.The program consists of a matrix which for each possible data read by the read/write head and for each 'inner state' (column of the matrix) has three data stored:- a new state for the machine- an output signal to write back onto the tape - a direction into which the head has to move next.In principle, any program in the world can be processed this way.  Click GO to let the game guide you through the steps of the Turing Machine cycles. Or click run to let the Turing Machine compute nonstop until it has finished the calculation.  The default variant has a string of Ones on the tape, and the program matrix is designed so that the Turing Machine converts it into a binary number.  The input/output string in this game alows only five different characters to be used in the input string: blank, 0, 1, =, *.However, the real meaning of these signs is up to you. The program itself gives these signs the true meaning. The star, for example, can stand for any mathematical operator.  Variant 2: add two binary numbers.Variant 3: subtract two binary numbers.Variant 4: copy a binary number. Variant 5: double a binary number. Variant 6: empty program, for you to encode.  All programs and tapes are fully editable by you; just click the entries. Rightclick the matrix state entries (letters) for more information. Hence just by clicking you can reprogram this Turing Machine and make it do what you want.Also vary the input for the given programs and see what happens.   The Turing Machine is named after Alan Turing, who was one of the founders of modern computer and information theory and investigated into the possibilities of this machine.  In principle the tape has infinite length at least at one end.More characters than 5 allowed for the input would request a larger matrix.The number of states (matrix files) also changes with the program.  In 1986 I built a mechanical Turing machine from a metal construction set, plastic pipes, strings, springs, and pieces of wood. Clicking 'GO' in this Zillions game, which leads you through the process in small steps, was thus replaced by pulling 12 strings, one after the other, proving that some old Greek scientist already could have built a computer!

Troyka","description":["This is a collection of Turn Off variants in which the pattern of light changes correspond to the moves of various fairy chess pieces. In the standard Turn Off that comes with Zillions, when a light is selected, it and all orthogonally adjacent lights change state. This corresponds to the Wazir fairy piece, which can move to any orthogonally adjacent piece. Variants included in this file feature the Wazir, Fers, Dabbaba, Ferdaba, Alfil, Squirrel, Camel, and Zebra. A description of the moves of each piece is included in the \"game description\" section. Each game starts with all lights on, and the goal is to turn them all off.  Curiously, the Zillions version of Turn Off does not include a variant that starts with all the lights on. It turns out that this is a very difficult puzzle. In my experience Zillions has been unable to find the solution on the higher settings. Set to \"stupid\" it will sometimes find a solution by accident but usually after several hundred moves.  So the challenge is: Find the efficient solution to the Wazir 5x5 Turn Off puzzle. You can cheat all you want. The first person to send me the correct answer at dtroyka@justice.com gets a certified smiley emoticon. :-)  Wazir Challenge is a companion game to Royal Turnoff.  UPDATE: Robert Gauss and Jeff Roy both solved this puzzle the week it came out. We all agree that the shortest solution is in 15 moves. This solution is now included with the game in a Solutions folder, which you can also access through the \"Show Solution\" option in the Help menu.  The order in which lights are selected is irrelevant because the state of a light -- off or on -- depends solely on how many times it or a neighboring light has been selected, not on the order of selection. A priori it is clear that the optimal solution cannot be over 25 turns. Selecting a light twice is the same as not selecting it at all (the second click undoes the first click), so an efficient solution cannot contain multiple selections of the same light.  Jeff Roy provided an interesting proof that the largest number of turns in the efficient solution to any solvable 5x5 Wazir puzzle is 17 turns. (By efficient I mean that all doublets have been subtracted out and that each light is selected either once or not at all.) He identified a \"return pattern\" of 16 distinct lights that, when selected, returns the board to the starting pattern so that no change in board state occurs. This pattern is a2, a3, a4, b1, b3, b5, c1, c2, c4, c5, d1, d3, d5, e2, e3, and e4. To summarize the proof: Suppose there is an efficient path of 18 moves from an initial state to a final state. A player could then add the 16 lights in the return pattern, which would create a list of 34 moves leading from the initial state to the final state. In this list of 34 moves there must be at least 9 doublets because there are nine more moves than there are lights on the board. (There can be no triplets because each pattern is composed of distinct selections.) If these doublets are subtracted out, you arrive at the same board state in 16 or fewer moves, which is a contradiction. Ergo, there is no such thing as an efficient path of 18 moves."],"category":"solitaire","themes":[2,11],"variations":17}

(6 random and 30 fixed setups)   This is the story of Whitey, the polar bear, who lived on ice floes in the arctic. At first you see Whitey swimming in the arctic waters looking for an ice floe to climb onto. Click an ice floe with a low number to start the game. Whitey cannot not stay long on any ice floe because the floes are melting. At any move, he must jump to another of the ice floes left, the next always carrying a bigger number than the last. How long can you keep Whitey happy?   Before you start, turn on Smart Moves via View/Options/Board/SmartMoves. Click a board position to drop a Whitey to mark the starting position. From now on click numbers with increasing value (like 2,5,7,11,12....)   You can only visit a destination which carries a number bigger than the number of the previous destination. You can jump as far as you like over unvisited numbers, but they will disappear. (In some variants the jumped numbers stay). You can also jump over empty positions. You can go into any of eight directions and you can turn with every move.   Your goal is to visit as many ice floes as possible. The number of positions you have visited as well as the length of the longest known tour are shown at the right border. The border also shops the number of the ice floe the bear is on. All solutions have been found by hand, so you might be able to improve on them.   30 fixed setups: Variant  1 to  5: 16 destinations on 4x4 board. Variant  6 to 10: 25 destinations on 5x5 board. Variant 11 to 15: 36 destinations on 6x6 board. Jumped numbers stay: Variant 16 to 20: 16 destinations on 4x4 board. Variant 21 to 25: 25 destinations on 5x5 board.

Technical Information: Like my Zillions game 'Flamingos', the game 'Whitey' uses two board positions on the same coordinates in order to display two superimposed images  (here number and Whitey with polar bear) at the same time and place. It might be useful for other authors to study those two games to understand how this has been achieved. The disadvantage is that during replay the polar bear is not visible. An alternative method would be to have all images of numbers copied with the polar bear on them, thereby doubling the number of pieces and images.

It is easy to code the logical gates AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOT in Wireworld. By combining such gates the workings of a computer can be simulated. The default variant shows the NOT gate, the next variant the OR gate and so on.The 'electron' gun on the left emits one electron every 12 cycles, just to demopnstrate the NOT gate. The interval between data ('electron' or 'not electron') at the output is 6 cycles. Distance between electrons for this gate to operate properly: multiples of 6 cycles.  Click button '1' ('6', '30', '00') to run one, six, thirty cycles or forever. This will show how the 'electrons' move through the 'wires'. The 'hook' sign to the right is the sign for the logical 'NOT'.  Apart from showing the famous Wireworld setup, this game 'Wireworlds' also allows you to create a whole class of automatons (all closely related to the orginal Wireworld) by clicking the 'Y' buttons at the right border. The number of Red neighbors determines whether a Yellow square turns Red,the number of Blue neighbors determines whether a Red square turns Blue,the number of Yellow neighbors determines whether a Blue square turns Yellow.  Clicking a Y-button on advances a cell's stage. E.g., the buttons in the column underneath the red square determine when Red turns to Blue. A few additional buttons are for the convenience to trigger several buttons simultaneously: Row of coloured buttons: Click a colour to reset a whole column to 'Y' or blank. Numbers of neighbors: Click to reset a whole row to 'Y' or blank.  Click the left, right, up, down buttons to shift the pattern on the board.You can click the board to edit it.

(30 variants) If a shape tiles a rectangle, then this rectangle is called a 'prime rectangle' or a 'prime' for short, if it is minimal in the sense that it cannot be cut into smaller rectangles which also can be tiled by the given shape. Hence for each shape that is 'rectifiable' (i.e. which can tile a rectangle), it is an interesting task to find all prime rectangles ('primes') for this tile. For any given tile there can only be a finite number of such rectangles. For the Y-pentomino we present here all known prime rectangles small enough to fit onto our board of size 32x32. The Y-pentomino is represented by five square tokens.The system will automatically change the colour of the tokens after you have put down 5 tokens. The system guides you through the placing of the five tokens per tile: Place two squares side by side, then a third orthogonally next to the second. The system will drop the remaining two squares automatically.  You can DELETE a placed pentomino by simply clicking the three squares which you placed on the board when you created the tile. You win if you manage to fill the given rectangle. Solutions (zsg files) for most variants are attached. Please note that there are three piece sets available.  The primes 10x16, 15x16 and 15x22 were first published by C.J. Bouwkamp and D.A. Klarner in JRM(3(1), which used a computer.The 15x15 prime was found by Jennifer Hazelgrove with a computer (see JRM 7(3)). All other primes were found by hand (!) by the author (9x20, 9x30, 10x14, 11x20, 14x15, 17x30, 21x25, 25x27), see Journal of Recreational Mathematics Vol 12(3), 1979-80. Astonishingly, my results found by hand bettered some of the earlier results found by computer. Some of my results on prime rectangles (10x23, 11x30, 17x30, 18x25, 21x25) are published with this Zillions game for the first time.

Note that you can also redesign the fill-in area in all variants in order to create your own tiling problems.  Much material has been published on polysquares.
