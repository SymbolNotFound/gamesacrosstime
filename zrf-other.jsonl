Players win by connecting their edges of the board with a chain of their marbles. Marbles are connected if they touch orthogonally (squarely) or one rests directly upon the other.  If a chain crosses over another chain then the uppermost chain prevails; the lower chain is cut until the upper connection is removed (over/under rule).  Each turn the current player must either:(1) Drop one of their marbles onto an empty board hole, or;(2) Pick up one of their marbles and move it to a connected valid empty point. The marble cannot have more than one marble resting directly upon it from the level above.  An empty point is valid if it is either a board hole, or a flat stable square formed by four adjacent supporting marbles on the level below. A point is connected if a path can be traced from it back to the piece being moved, by stepping through adjacent pieces of the same colour. At least one other piece must be involved in the connected path.  Moving a marble may cause higher marbles to drop. Any dropping marbles are removed from the connectivity and support calculations for that move. That is, any marble whichs drops cannot be used as a support piece for that move, nor can it be used as part of the path connecting any destination point.  First move equalisation: The player to move second may capture the opening piece by replacement.

A Pod can orbit around a pivot through any number of empty spaces or through outer space (off the board) provided it comes to rest on an empty space on the board.  It must land in a space adjacent to the pivot in the forward direction.  A Pod cannot capture.","When a Pod reaches the shaded area on the far side of the board, it promotes to a War Pod.  A War Pod moves like a regular Pod, with the exception that it can land on any orbital space (i.e., forward progress is not required), and it captures any enemy piece that it orbits around.","When a War Pod returns to the shaded area on its own side of the board, it promotes to a Death Pod.  A Death Pod moves like a War Pod, with the added condition that it captures any enemy piece that it lands next to.","Because pieces must have pivots to move, an isolated piece is frozen. The game is won by scattering the enemy fleet and leaving it with no move.  A player who has no pieces or no moves at the start of a turn loses.","Two training variants are included.  In the first, the object is to promote a Pod into a War Pod.  This variant focuses attention on the \"civilian phase\" of Altairain Checkers in which Pods maneuver for position without overtly hostile intent.  This phase is characterized by the tactics of stalemate and zugzwang.  In the second training variant, the object is to promote a War Pod into a Death Pod.  This variant adds the \"battle\" phase to the \"civilian\" phase and focuses attention on gaining the edge in battle through construction of an ultimate weapon.","Both of the training variants are virtually draw-proof.  Full Altairian Checkers usually draws when both players have an equal number of Death Pods and no other pieces.  This is a draw by mutually assured destruction."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":3}

Arimaa was designed to be difficult for computers to play, yet easy for people to learn and play.   A challenge of $10,000 USD is offered to the  first person or company that can build a computer program which can defeat the best Arimaa player  prior to 2020.   Objective The first player to get just one Rabbit across the board to the other side wins. If both players lose all their Rabbits the game is a draw.   Setup The game has no fixed starting position for the pieces.  The game starts with an empty board.  First Gold sets down all the pieces in any order on  the first 2 rows.  Silver can then set down all the pieces on the first 2 rows closest to Silvers side.  Once the peices have been set down the players take turn moving the pieces with Gold going first. Each player has 8 Rabbits, 2 Cats, 2 Dogs, 2 Horses, 1 Camel and 1 Elephant.   Steps In each turn the players can take up to 4 steps. All pieces move the same way, which is laterally (i.e. left, right, forward and back). Except that Rabbits cannot move  backwards.  Moving a piece from its current square to an adjacent square counts  as one step.  The 4 steps can be distributed across multiple pieces.  Thus a player  can move one piece 4 steps, four pieces 1 step each,one piece 3 steps and another  piece 1 step,  etc. The same piece may take steps in different directions. At least  1 step must be taken on each turn to change the state of the board.   Pushing and Pulling A piece can push opponents weaker pieces to any laterally adjacent square and  move into its place. This is called 'pushing' and uses up 2 steps; one for  pushing the opponents piece and one for moving into its square. Pushing must  be completed within a players turn and cannot be distributed across turns.  The Elephant is the strongest and can push any other piece except another Elephant. The Elephant is followed in strength by the Camel, then the Horse, Dog, Cat and finally the Rabbit which is the weakest and cannot push any other piece.  Pieces of equal strength cannot push each other. A piece can also pull opponents weaker pieces which are laterally adjacent into the square that it moved from.  This is called 'pulling' and uses up 2 steps; one for moving the piece and one for pulling the opponents piece. A piece cannot pull while completing a push.   Freezing A piece that is alone and laterally adjacent to an opponents stronger piece is  considered 'frozen' and cannot move. A piece is considered to be alone if there is no friendly pieces laterally adjacent to it. The lonely weaker piece  can be 'unfrozen' by moving any other friendly piece next to it. When no longer  alone the weaker piece is unfrozen and can immediately begin to move within  the same turn.   Traps The squares c3, f3, c6 and f6 are called 'traps'. Any piece that is standing  on a trap square is immeadiatly removed from the board if there are no friendly piece laterally adjacent to it. A piece may safely stand on or pass through a trap square as long as there is a friendly piece adjacent to it. If the friendly piece moves away then the lonely  piece on the trap square is immeadiately removed from the board.    The development of Arimaa began on January 15th 1999 while Omar Syed was trying to teach his son Aamir how to play Chess.  By the way the name Arimaa is really A followed by Aamir spelled backwards."],"category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":0}

It bears some resemblance to Halma. In England this game is also called Officers and Sepoys after the Indian revolt in 1857-58 when Indian troops (Sepoys) revolted against their British officers. The Soldiers should be prepared to sacrifice themselves in order to divert the Officers from the defence of the fortress. It is a challenging task for the Soldiers player. The Officers make the first move.","In the classic version the pieces are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. This pattern restricts piece movement and occurs on Asalto boards from the 18th century. The object of the attacking Soldiers is to occupy the Fortress (the lower nine holes) or to surround the two defending Officers so they can't move. Unlike the Officers the Soldiers cannot move backwards. The object of the Officers is to capture enough Soldiers so they can't occupy all nine positions in the fortress.","The Officer moves to any empty, adjacent hole. If an adjacent hole is occupied by a Soldier and the hole directly behind is vacant, then the Officer must jump over it and capture it, as in checkers. Several Soldiers may be captured like this in a single turn. The Soldier steps diagonally and orthogonally down, left, or right. It can't capture. Remember that you can add or remove Soldiers from the initial position so that it reflects your playing strength.","In the German version the Soldier steps straight down or diagonally down. It may only move left or right at the lowest side of the arms (otherwise it would be stuck there). This variant seems the most difficult for the Soldiers.","I have also invented a modern version (if it's not already invented) which does not utilize the Alquerque board pattern and where diagonal movement for the Officers is thus unrestricted. In this version the Soldier side has even more pieces. Soldiers move only orthogonally and not backwards. It is played on a solitaire board.","Remember that you can add or remove Soldiers from the initial position so that it reflects your playing strength."],"category":"other","themes":[5,12,37],"variations":6}

These are quite attractive hunt-games which are played on triangular boards. The Tiger side plays with one or several Tiger pieces. The White side plays with 5-15 Leopards (also known as 'dogs' or 'lambs'). The Leopards must all be dropped before they are moved. Pieces move by sliding along a line to an adjacent vacant point. The Tiger may also capture a Leopard by jumping over it as in checkers, but only a single Leopard may be taken each turn. Capture is not mandatory.","The Leopards win if the Tiger(s) are immobilized so they(he) can't move.

It must land immediately behind the captured piece and captures must be maximized. It may not continue capture in the reverse direction.","A Man has a shield which protects it from capture. If the shield is directed toward an enemy piece, the latter cannot capture it. It is possible to change direction of the shield when making a step move (but not when capturing).

The Core is the yellow area at the center of the playing field.  Play begins with removal of the Control Rods from the Core and their placement on empty spaces of the playing field. Spaces which are not adjacent to another Control Rod nor the edge of the playing field. Each player picks up and places one Control Rod per turn until all the Control Rods have been placed. Once a Control Rod is placed on the playing field, it cannot be moved the remainder of the game.  Each of the Atoms are made up of three types of particles, four Electrons, two Protons and one Neutron. Each particle can be moved according to the following rules:  ELECTRONS and PROTONSThese two particles may move by orbiting and free-flight.Orbiting consists of moving around, through empty spaces, an adjacent particle or Control Rod.An Electron and Proton may orbit any one particle or Control Rod. Free-flight is accomplished by an Electron or Proton when it is only adjacent to particles of its kind. When that adjacent particle is behind and an empty space is in front, the Electron or Proton may fly in a straight line until it strikes another particle, a Control Rod or the edge of the playing field.  If an Electron strikes a Proton, the Proton becomes a Neutron.If a Proton strikes an Electron, the Electron becomes a Neutron.If an Electron strikes a Neutron, the Neutron becomes n Electron.If a Proton strikes a Neutron, the Neutron becomes a Proton.If an Electron strikes an Electron, or a Proton strikes a Proton, it preforms a deflecting bounce.If an Electron or Proton strikes the edge of the playing field, they preform a reflecting bounce.If an Electron or Proton strikes a Control Rod, it stops movement.  A deflecting bounce consists of a change in direction of travel, either right-forward or left-forward.A reflecting bounce consists of a change in direction of travel, either right-forward, left-forward, right-backward or left-backward. Only one bounce, either deflecting or reflecting, is permitted per turn. If the bounce would result in a possible second bounce, the first bounce cannot be preformed.At the end of the bounce, either reflecting or deflecting, all strike conditions must be observed.  NEUTRONSNeutron can only orbit. They cannot orbit other Neutrons or Control Rods.  A player may move any particle on the playing field, after all Control Rod placements, under the following restrictions:","A player may not move any particle, or its surrounding particles, which the opponent last moved.","Particles in the Core cannot be moved. A player can lose the game, if at the end of the turn there is only one Proton or Electron left. Or the outer rim of the Core is filled and there is no Neutron in its center.

Capturing is mandatory. A checker may keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible.","When your Checker reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a King.

The rules are simple:Win by moving a piece to the opposite side.Pieces move forward or diagonally forward and capture diagonally forward. Because the pieces have no choice but to move forward, the game develops quickly. Draws are impossible. The game is similar to a pawn promotion battle, except that the pieces move diagonally forward even when not capturing. This diagonal motion allows you to 'skirt' by an opponent piece by facing it head on, where it cannot capture you, and then moving diagonally around it.As a result, a single piece cannot by itself prevent an opponent piece from 'breaking through' the ranks. When pieces are spaced out along diagonals, an opponent piece can easily skirt through them. Look for weak links in your opponent's defenses where a single piece to the rear is guarding two attack routes.

Parker","notes":"1887","description":["Camelot is one of the great boardgames of the nineteenth century, along with Reversi and Halma. Invented in 1887 by George S. Parker, founder of Parker Brothers, it was originally marketed under the name Chivalry. The game achieved a substantial following after its re-release in 1930, with minor rule changes, under the name Camelot. Its players included chess champion Jose Raoul Capablanca, also known as the inventor of Capablanca Chess. In recent years the World Camelot Federation has rekindled interest in the game. To learn more about the history of Camelot, and to join the Federation, visit http://communities.msn.com/worldcamelotfederation. Camelot was featured in an article in the seventh edition (summer 2001) of Abstract Games Magazine.  Camelot is played on a 12x16 board, with eight squares removed from each of the corners to give the board an oval shape. To see a notation key, select \"Switch Piece Set\" from the View menu. Two spaces protrude from both the top and bottom of the board. These are called the \"castles.\" The object of the game is to occupy the enemy castle by moving two of your pieces into it. You also win by capturing all opponent pieces, provided you have at least two pieces remaining. A draw is declared if both players are reduced to a single piece. Stalemate is a loss.  Each player starts the game with 14 pieces, consisting of ten Men and four Knights. A Man has three basic moves. It may move one space in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal.

A Soldier moves one step in all directions. It can also jump forwards and sideways over any piece except a Castle. Jumps in the three backwards directions only occur when making a capture. In its first move, the Soldier may go two steps.","A Soldier captures an enemy Soldier by jumping over it. Soldiers can capture a Castle by surrounding it on three sides orthogonally. A Soldier may continue jumping as long as possible, but it cannot jump back immediately from where it came. If you want to stop jumping prematurely, press \"Pass Move\". The four nearest Castles are friendly and cannot be captured. The middle Castles are neutral and can be captured by both players. But the central Castle cannot be captured before one of the Castles on the enemy side has been captured. This game is remarkably similar to a medieval battle situation. If you want to set up a position, please use the alternative variant, as this ensures functionality.","Castello was designed by Carl Renström. It was first published by BRIO in 1965.

Only twelve showed up.  To reward his guests, the Jade Emperor announced that     he would name a year of the Zodiac after each.  The animals were all duly honored.  But then the question of order arose.      The Ox, the most brawny of all the animals but also the most dull-witted, insisted he should be first due to his tremendous strength.     The Rat, puniest of all the animals but also the most cunning, argued he should be first due to his keen intelligence.  The other animals,    who possessed both strength and intelligence in varying degrees, soon joined the quarrel.  Some sided with the Ox, saying that strength was    more important than intelligence.  Others sided with the Rat, saying intelligence was more important than strength.  While still others wavered    back and forth.  So to settle the matter, the Rat proposed a contest.","This game uses the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac.  Each animal possesses    its own unique combination of strength and intelligence.  During the first phase, strength is crucial; in the second phase, intelligence is valued.","The    board starts off empty.  The players alternately place their pieces on their sides of the board.  Each piece must be placed on the unoccupied  yellow spaces    within their first three rows.  The direction a piece is facing indicates which player it belongs to.  After each player has placed all their twelve pieces,    the game can begin.  North, for having gone second during the set-up stage, gets to move first.","An animal can not capture an animal stronger than itself.     The animals are ranked in strength, from strongest to weakest:  12. Ox, 11. Tiger, 10. Dragon, 9. Horse, 8. Dog, 7. Goat, 6. Pig, 5. Snake, 4. Rooster, 3. Monkey, 2. Hare, 1. Rat.","When an animal reaches the far rank, it is removed to the side and scored according to its intelligence.  The animals are ranked in intelligence, from smartest to dumbest:  12. Rat,    11. Hare, 10 Monkey, 9. Rooster, 8. Snake, 7. Pig, 6. Goat, 5. Dog, 4. Horse, 3. Dragon, 2. Tiger, 1. Ox.  As can be seen, an animal's intelligence is in inverse proportion to its strength.     In other words, the weaker the animal the more valuable it is and vice-versa.","Other than this, normal Checkers rules apply.  Pieces can only move diagonally forward, either by sliding    to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side.  Jumping over a piece captures it.   Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping    and capturing as long as it is possible.","When one player is unable to make a move, by either having no more pieces left on the Checkerboard, or by having all his pieces blocked from movement,    the game ends and the player with the higher score wins.  [Note:  Zillions occasionally miscalculates the winner.]","Incidentally, through prudent and skillful play the Rat was able to easily    defeat the brute efforts of the Ox.

The 45-square board doubles as a rule table,","and each move enforces one rule even as it changes another. The game ends","when no further moves can be made, meaning the rules have stabilized, and","all rules have been enforced. In the end the winner (if any) is the player","with the most stones on the board.","The two players are called X and Y, after the horizontal and vertical axes.","How the current rules affect a given square is determined by","how many X and Y stones surround the square in the eight directions: if the","number of player-X neighbors is x, and the number of player-Y neighbors is y, look at the","given square's 'rule square' at position (x,y) on the board, viewed as a table.","Viewed as a 'rule', an X stone at position (x,y) proclaims: 'Any square with","x player-X neighbors and y player-Y neighbors shall have an X stone'. Analogously if the (x,y)","square has a Y stone, or is empty. A player's move enforces one such 'rule'.","In the main variant, small dots and holes are used to indicate the possible","moves, giving four types of pieces:","Potential (small dot): this square is 'really' empty, but there is a stone","on the 'rule square', so the owner of the this Potential can change this to","a Stable stone.","Stable (solid stone): this stone is supported by a friendly stone on the","'rule square', so this Stable stone cannot be taken or flipped.","Unstable (stone with hole): this stone's 'rule square' is empty, so this","Unstable stone can be taken by the enemy player.","Reversible (stone with center of opposite color): this stone's 'rule square'","has a stone of opposite color, so the enemy player can flip this to a Stable","stone of the enemy color.","All the indicators are automatically updated on each move. Note that Potentials","don't count as stones; they represent empty squares where stones can be added.","Players cannot take or flip their own pieces; they must pass when they have no","legal moves. The game ends when both players are forced to pass.","There are many possible final states. The most likely outcome is that one player","takes over the whole board, or that the board is cleared by mutual annihilation.","There is also a fairly frequent situation where one player occupies just over half","the board, winning 23 to 22. It's also possible to end up with a stable block of","four stones (similar to the blocks in Life), or many isolated stones supported by","a self-stable one in the lower left-hand corner.","Strategically, the most basic idea is to match rules to patterns and vice versa, that is,","place stones on squares that represent patterns that exist or are about to","exist in the current situation. Conversely, you can try to create patterns that","correspond to the rules of squares you already control. For example, in the","early stages, there are few pieces on the board, so the squares on the lower","left tend to be the most important, but as the board fills up, the emphasis","moves gradually outward. A player with dominance in the lower left corner,","conversely, might do well to try to keep the board sparse by taking unstable","pieces.","The other variant, Cellf Classic, represents the game as it is played on a physical board. No indicators","are used, just stones. This is harder for humans to play, but Zillions is faster with this variant,","and sometimes more accurate, because the Potentials of the main variant can skew the values, since","they count as pieces.","Thanks to Dan Troyka for an implementation hint.","Piece images were created with the aid of the fabulous POV-Ray(tm) ray","tracer."],"category":"other","themes":[3,12],"variations":2}

It is designed to increase the winning chances for the player who is one Man up.","Brazilian Checkers (Minor Polish draughts) follows the same rules as International Draughts.

Capture is mandatory, but it is not mandatory to capture the longest line (i.e. it is not necessary to choose the series of jumps that captures the most men). The game is the same as Northern German checkers, which is played on a mirrored board. The first book covering German Draughts was the 155-page folio volume \"Die unterschiedlichen Spiel- und Vorstellungen des weltberühmten Damspiels\", which was published around 1700 in Nuremberg by Johann Wolfgang Schmidt (cf. checkers.wikia.com).

Parker, founder of Parker Brothers. The game achieved a substantial following after its re-release in 1930, with minor rule changes, under the name Camelot. In recent years the World Camelot Federation has rekindled interest in the game. To learn more about the history of Chivalry, and to join the Federation, visit the Federation's web site at http://groups.msn.com/worldcamelotfederation/homepage.","Chivalry is played on a 14x16 board, with six squares removed from each of the corners to give the board an oval shape. To see a notation key, select \"Switch Piece Set\" from the View menu. Two spaces protrude from both the top and bottom of the board. These are called the \"castles.\" The object of the game is to occupy the enemy castle by moving two of your pieces into it. You also win by capturing all opponent pieces, provided you have at least two pieces remaining. A draw is declared if both players are reduced to a single piece. Stalemate is a loss.","Each player starts the game with 20 pieces, consisting of twelve Men and eight Knights. A Man has three basic moves. It may move one space in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal. This is called a \"plain\" move. It may jump over a friendly adjacent piece and continue jumping, at its option, as long as friendly pieces remain to be jumped. This move is called \"cantering.\" And it may jump over an enemy piece, thereby capturing it, in which case it must continue jumping as long as captures are available. A Man may not canter and capture in the same move.","The Knight has all the moves of the Man plus one important addition, called the Knight's \"charge.\" A charge consists of a cantering move (or series) followed by capturing. Once a Knight makes a capture, it must continue making captures if available and may not return to cantering.","Circular canters, i.e., canters that return to an already visited square, are not permitted. Visited squares are indicated by flags. The flags are cleared at the end of the cantering sequence. To pass on further canters, move the piece to the Knight graphic of your color in the lower left or upper right corner of the board. The piece will not actually change location.","Capturing is compulsory but there is no requirement of choosing a path of maximal captures. A player is not required to make a Knight's charge, with the exception that when a capture is directly available, the player may satisfy the compulsory capture rule through a Knight's charge. When cantering a Knight must make a capture if one becomes directly available but may do so through a charge.","Special rules govern the castle. Once a piece enters the enemy castle, it may never leave. A piece in the enemy castle is permitted to move laterally twice during the game. You may never enter your own castle except through a capture, in which case the piece must be moved out as soon as possible. If the piece cannot move out through another capture on the same turn, then it must be moved out on the next turn (even if this means declining a capture elsewhere on the board).

{"zrfID":225,"id":"congklak","name":"Congklak ","programmerID":6,"programmer":"W. D. Troyka","created":"2001-09-08","description":["Congklak is a Mancala game played in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Phillipines. It is known by a variety of regional names, including Sungka and Dakon. The game is essentially a hybrid of Kalah and Endodoi, also available on Zillions. It employs the capturing method of Kalah with the multi-lap sowing of Endodoi.  Congklak was featured on the cover page of the second edition of Abstract Games Magazine. Unlike Kalah, Congklak is an indigenous game with a long history of local play. As explained in more detail in the \"History\" section to Kalah, the game Kalah was likely derived from Congklak by an American game enthusiast in the early 20th century.  Congklak is traditionally played on 2x5 and 2x7 boards with cowrie shells or similar counters. This version is played with rubies. (You must pre-apply with our credit department before playing.) The number of rubies in each hole at the start of a game corresponds to the number of holes on each side of the board. Unlike most Mancala games, sowing takes place in the clockwise direction. Rubies are sown into a player's store -- but not the enemy store -- and into the lift hole on subsequent laps.  A turn consists of sowing the rubies from a hole on the player's side of the board. In the 2x7 version (the default), if the last ruby is dropped in the store, the player gets another turn starting from any friendly occupied hole. If the last ruby is dropped in an occupied hole, the rubies in that hole, including the last ruby dropped, are picked up and a new sowing begins as part of the same turn. You can make up to twenty moves in a single turn in this implementation. If the last ruby drops in an empty hole on the player's side of the board, any rubies in the enemy hole directly opposite are captured along with the last ruby dropped, and the turn ends. If the last ruby drops in an empty enemy hole or in an empty friendly hole opposite an empty enemy hole, the turn ends without any captures.  In the 2x5 version, if the last ruby from a sowing lands in the player's store, the turn ends without further moves. I have adopted this rule from the Abstract Games Magazine article. Although most descriptions of Congklak provide that sowing into the store gives you an extra turn, in the 2x5 version the bottom player can win the game on the first turn -- without the top player ever making a move! -- if such moves are permitted.  For the complete rule set, please read the \"Game Description\" that comes with the game.  Please send any comments or bug reports to dtroyka@justice.com.

(The King is always allowed to sacrifice itself.) The rule is only valid for slides. Thus, the King may always jump over a threatened square while performing a capture. This rule is designed to make the game less drawish.

For example, in Frisian Checkers, orthogonal directions can only be used when jumping the opponent's pieces and pieces must always stick to same color of the checkerboard.","The two diagonally opposite corners are specially marked.  These spaces are referred to as \"Coronation Squares.\"","A Pawn can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, but only forward - that is in the direction of the opposite corner.

Jumps can be performed in all eight directions.  Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible, taking the maximum number of pieces.  Captured pieces are left on the board until the chain of jumps is completed and the same piece may not be jumped twice.

Draws may occur by mutual impotence or three-fold repetition of moves.  A \"line of men\" means a straight unbroken orthogonal or diagonal line of men of the same color. A man or a line of men moves one square forward, either orthogonally or diagonally. A man ending its move on the opponent's back rank promotes to king. Kings move like Chess queens, any number of unobstructed squares orthogonally or diagonally.  Although pieces may move diagonally, all captures follow horizontal and vertical (i.e. orthogonal) lines only. Men may capture forwards, backwards and sideways by the short leap. Kings may move queenwise, but they capture only rookwise, by the long leap. Capturing, whether by men or kings, is compulsory. Multiple captures may be made in the same turn. The captured pieces are only removed at the end of the turn, and it is not allowed to jump over the same piece twice in that turn, although vacant squares may be passed over more than once. Majority capture takes precedence: if a player has a choice of capturing options, he must choose the option that results in the largest number of pieces being captured (kings and men counting equally).   Croda Included as a variant, even though the game precedes Dameo, is Croda, a draughts game invented in 1995 by Ljuban Dedic of Croatia, 1989 Checkers champion of former Yugoslavia. Croda actually was the inspiration to invent Dameo. Many things are equal between the two - apart from an other initial position, there are only some differences in movement. In Croda, there's no linear movement - a man only moves on his own. And a king moves as a rook in chess: any number of unobstructed squares orthogonally. All the other rules of Dameo equally apply to Croda.","Dameo is just one of the games invented by Christian Freeling; they can all be seen, and some of them played, on the internet in the MindSports ArenA."],"image":"game298_scr_Dameo.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":2}

While the pattern restricts piece movement one can introduce orthogonal movement without making the game too complicated. The idea is to propose a less forced form of Checkers. Pieces move forward, either straight or diagonally. They may capture (jump) only diagonally forwards (like in Checkers). Goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces. Pieces are promoted to kings at the last rank. Kings move and capture in all directions. Capture is obligatory. Stalemate is a loss.","As a variant is included another invention of mine, Damtafl, which is inspired from the Viking game Halatafl.

A DIPOLE is a piece of size 2x1 or 1x2, where one pole is red and the other pole is blue. Dip places vertical dipoles only, and Ole horizontal ones. The player with the last move wins the game.  Poles of the same color repel each other. So they are not allowed to lie side to side. Furthermore, the board has an underlying \"outer field\", indicated by lightly red and lightly blue squares. Red poles may only be dropped on lightly red squares, and blue poles only on lightly blue squares. In the beginning of a game the outer field is generated randomly by pressing the start button or clicking any square.  Dip drops a vertical dipole by clicking the lower part of the destination. Ole drops a horizontal dipole by clicking the left part of the destination. For human players it helps a lot to activate the feature that shows all legal moves, especially in play against Zillions.  Dipole contains some elements of the more traditional games CrossCram (=Domineering) and British Square. In Zillions, Dipole comes in three variants for board sizes 8x8, 10x10, and 13x13.

Perkis","notes":"1999","description":["PLAYING EQUIPMENT -- The board pattern is composed ot two separate but superimposed networks, one red and the other green.  Likewise, there are two sets of twelve pieces -- one of each colour.","SETTING UP -- Choose any random method to decide who plays which colour.  Players then face each other with the board placed lengthways between them and so oriented that they each have the broad border line of their own colour at their near end.  At start of play, both players arrange their pieces on their three near rows, using the playing points that match the colour they are playing.  Throughout the game, pieces stay on their own colour and always move by following lines of that colour.","THE OBJECT OF THE GAME for each player is to be the first to have four pieces planted on the opposing player's first row (in other words, their own far row).  This wins even if the other player could match it or take one of the pieces on their next move.","MOVES -- The player with red starts and thereafter each player in turn moves a piece along a line of their own colour to the nearest playing point of that colour.  On your turn of play you may only move one piece and only one piece may occupy a playing point at any moment.  As long as a player is able to move, he or she must do so.  Except when making a capture (see next section), pieces can only move forwards:  either directly or diagonally.  Note that any orthogonal move (i.e., not a diagonal one) bypasses an enemy playing point.  Such a move can only be made if the intervening point is unoccupied.  This rule applies to capturing moves also.","CAPTURES are by custodianship, or \"sandwiching.\"  When a move is made which results in an enemy piece being sandwiched -- either vertically or horizontally -- then the sandwiched piece is removed from the board.  Often two (and sometimes three) pieces can be captured in one go.  Four is possible but unlikely.  Capturing is optional rather than compulsory.  Unlike other moves, capturing moves can be made in any direction.  A piece can be moved to a point between two enemy pieces (i.e., into a sandwich) without being captured.  A piece that does so, however, can often be taken immediately afterwards by a move which completes an alternatively oriented sandwich on it.  When a piece moves into a sandwich, it can still effect a capture in the normal way.","RULES CONCERNING PIECES ON THE FAR ROW -- When a piece has reached the far row it may not be moved again except to capture.  If it moves sideways to do so, it stays at the point moved to -- unless it makes another capturing move later.  However, if a piece moves back off the far row in order to capture, then the restriction against non-capturing moves ceases.  Pieces on the far row have no protection against being taken although it is worth noting that it is not possible to capture a piece on a corner point.  Of course, once a winning occupation of the far row has been completed, no piece can be taken and the game ends.","FURTHER POINTS ABOUT HOW THE GAME MAY END -- A player would normally give up when he or she is reduced to three pieces, cannot move, or has pieces so badly placed that a winning occupation of the far row cannot be achieved.  In all such cases, however, the game can also be played out to the finish if the defending player wishes.  Whenever one player is unable to move, the other simply continues with successive moves, which may continue until the game is concluded.  In the rare event of neither player being able to get four pieces to their far row, the result is a draw.","Please send any comments or bug reports to  dtroyka@justice.com."],"image":"game319_scr_DoubleTake.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":0}

So it cannot capture backwards as immediate move.","Discussion","Most Western checkers variants belong to either of two groups, International/Polish or Spanish. In the former, a Man may capture backwards; in the latter only forwards. The problem with backwards capture is that the defence becomes easy. Although a Man advances, it retains control of squares in the rear. The problem with the Spanish group is that it has less combinatorial complexity, due to less capture directions.","Draughts with Deferred Backwards Capture keeps the advantages of both. Although A Man can also capture backwards, it may only do this later, as part of a series. It means that the defence becomes more difficult. A Man may sneak behind the back of an enemy Man and reach a promotion square. This vouches for a less drawish game. Moreover, the advanced and interesting combinatorial aspects of International/Polish variants are retained. Arguably, the introduction of the deferred backwards capture rule is a significant improvement. Worse endgames will become more difficult to hold. Although this variant is an invention of undersigned, the rule already exists in a traditional Gothic (orthogonal) checkers variant (\"Armenian checkers II\"), where a Man may not capture southwards as immediate move. However, here the strategical impact of the rule is less pronounced.","Proposed variants","The following variants have been implemented. The deferred backwards capture rule is combined with any of the following. In International Draughts, three Kings against one King is seldom a win, which tends to make the game drawish in grandmaster practice. Diverse halt rules have been proposed as a remedy. I introduce a new one, below.","Killer rule (Freeling, C.) When a King occurs as final capture, the captor must halt behind the enemy piece. Thus, two Kings will win against a lone King. (Arguably, this means an overly radical departure from the standard rules. After all, one should be able to play confidently for a draw with one Man less.)","Sequential killer rule (\"Killer light\") (Anikejev, J.) When a King occurs as the final capture of a series, the captor must halt behind the enemy piece. Thus, three Kings will win against a lone King. This variant (deferred backwards capture + killer light) would definitely solve the draw problem.","Sequential halt rule (Damme, A.K.W.) When any piece occurs as the final capture of a series, the captor must halt behind the enemy piece. Thus, three Kings will win against a lone King. (Arguably, this reduces the power of the King too much during the middlegame.)","Sequential halt rule II (\"Killer extra-light\") (Winther, M.) When two Kings occur as the final captures of a series, the captor must halt behind the enemy piece. Thus, three Kings will win against a lone King. This variant (deferred backwards capture + sequential halt rule II) would definitely solve the draw problem. With this rule, middlegame play is hardly affected at all.","Piece movement","A Man steps diagonally forwards. It captures, by the short leap, in all diagonal directions. A King slides and captures in all diagonal directions over any distance. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A King may \"fly\" over empty squares (\"long King\").","A Man promotes to King at the last rank. If a Man makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square and can continue capturing, it does not promote. One must continue capturing as long as possible. It is mandatory to select the longest capturing line. Captured pieces are removed only after the move is finished. The goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces.","The game is played on an 10x10 board with 20 pieces per player.

For a hexagonal variant see HexEmergo.Emergo has a better balance between strategic and tactical aspects than HexEmergo, hence Zillions is weaker at it.  Like checkers type games and Bushka, column checkers is about a simple two-men-three-squares scenario: put a black and a white man on adjacent squares. Now the white man can jump the black man, landing on the third (vacant) square and removing the jumped man from play. That's checkers type capture. Alternatively, the white man can jump the black man and taking it along underneath as a prisoner, landing on the third square. That's column checkers capture.  Now with a little imagination, one can see a man capturing several men as prisoners in a multiple capture. Next imagine this piece itself is jumped by the opponent: the guard is captured and the prisoners are now released! This released column can now in turn start to make prisoners and these will buried under several guards - to release them, the piece must be jumped a corresponding number of times!That's the general idea, and the most significant difference with checkers type capture is that no pieces ever leave the board! Obviously a win is achieved by capturing all the opponent's men.  A complete and illustrated explanation of the rules is included in the download.   Emergo derives from the Latin 'Luctor et Emergo', the motto of the Dutch province of Zeeland, and meaning 'I wrestle and emerge'. You'll find this name to be very appropriate.Emergo originates in the game Laska, invented by the legendary world champion Chess Emanuel Lasker.  Emergo is just one of the games invented by Christian Freeling; they can all be seen, and some of them played, on the internet in the MindSports ArenA.  (Hexagonal) Emergo is featured in R.

This process continues until the sowing ends in an empty hole. You can make up to twenty moves in a turn this way in this implementation.  Capturing in Endodoi is the same as in Kalah. When the sowing ends in an empty hole on the player's side of the board, any enemy beans in the hole directly opposite are captured and placed in the store. Sowing in Endodoi is counterclockwise. Beans are sowed into the lift hole on subsequent laps. Beans are not sowed into the store.  The complete rules of Endodoi can be found in the \"Game Description\" section that comes with the game.  In the variants, the players start with three, four, five, or six beans in each hole. A player wins by capturing more than half of all available beans.

Troyka","created":"2002-02-16","designerID":146,"designer":"Robert Abbott","notes":"1975","description":["Crossings (c) 1969 Robert Abbott.","Epaminondas, invented by Robert Abbott, is often described as a modern classic.  The game is named after a Theban general credited with innovations to the phalanx which led to the Theban victory over Sparta in 371 B.C.  Epaminondas was originally published in 1969 under the name Crossings in Sid Sackson's A Gamut of Games.  In 1975 Abbott released a revised version of the game, now called Epaminondas, played on a larger board and with a modified capturing rule.  The original Crossings is included as a variant in this package.  Both Epaminondas and Crossings are described in Wayne Schmittberger's New Rules for Classic Games (1992).  Epaminondas was featured in the third issue of Abstract Games Magazine (Autumn 2000) and favorably reviewed in David Parlett's Oxford History of Boardgames (1999). The game is profiled at Joao Pedro Neto's World of Abstract Games website at  www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv  and is available for play at Richard's play-by-email  server at www.gamerz.net/pbmserv.   To learn more about the game, and to check  out Robert Abbott's collection of mazes, puzzles, and games, visit his website  at www.logicmazes.com.","Epaminondas is played on a 14x12 board.  Each player begins with 28 pieces  occupying two rows on opposite sides of the board.  Motion in the game is  performed by phalanx.  A phalanx in the game consists of a line of adjacent  pieces (diagonal or orthogonal).  A single piece can be considered a  phalanx of one.  A phalanx moves along the line on which it is situated,  forward or backward, any number of spaces up unto the number of pieces  contained in the phalanx.  For example, four adjacent friendly pieces on a  common diagonal can move from one to four spaces, as a group, along the  diagonal in either direction.  Spaces moved through must be empty and the  lead piece in the phalanx must come to rest on an empty space or a space  occupied by an enemy.  In the latter case, the enemy piece and all enemy  pieces forming a phalanx behind it in the direction of motion will be  captured, but only if the moving phalanx is longer than the attacked  phalanx.  If the moving phalanx is shorter than or equal in length to the  attacked phalanx, the move cannot be made.","A part of a phalanx can be moved provided the part is itself a phalanx.   For example, if there are five adjacent friendly pieces in a row, two  pieces at one end can move forward one or two spaces as a phalanx of two,  or three pieces can move forward up to three spaces, and so on.  Pieces can  be part of multiple phalanxes.  A single piece moves like a King in chess,  one step to any adjacent empty square, but it can never capture.","The object of the game is to move a piece onto the far row (row 12 for  White, row 1 for Black).  When a player moves a piece onto the far row, the  opponent is given a grace move to equalize the situation by capturing the  piece just moved or by moving a piece itself onto its far row.  A win is  declared when a player has a piece on the far row (or one more piece than  the opponent has on its far row) and the opponent has completed the grace  move without equalizing the situation.  Repetition is a loss.","The Epaminondas 8x8 variant is, naturally, played on an 8x8 board.  The  game Crossings follows the original 1969 rules contained in A Gamut of  Games.  These rules are the same as for Epaminondas except that the board  is 8x8, a moving phalanx captures only the first enemy piece in the  attacked phalanx, and a piece that reaches the far row is frozen and can  neither move nor be captured.","Please send any comments or bug reports to  dtroyka@justice.com."],"category":"other","themes":[5,12,23],"variations":3}

The nine spaces at the edge of the board  farthest from where a player's pieces begin is that player's goal area.","Object: There are three ways to win:     Be the first player to move your General into the goal area.    Capture the opposing General.    Have all nine spaces of the goal area (toward which you are heading)        occupied at the end of your turn -- regardless of whose pieces are        on the goal spaces.  Movement: On each turn, the player may either move a piece or bring a Reserve onto  the board. All pieces move the same way: in a straight line, in any of the six  directions, to any unoccupied space. A piece may not jump over other pieces. A Reserve may be placed on any unoccupied space on the board.","Captures: Guards are captured by becoming \"sandwiched\" between two enemy pieces on  opposite sides. A Guard may safely move between two opposing pieces without being captured.  For a capture to occur, the capturing player must be the one who makes the move. A Reserve does not make a capture on the turn it is brought onto the board,  even if it causes an opposing Guard to be sandwiched. A General can only be captured if it is surrounded by enemy pieces on all  available sides (i.e. six sides if the General is somewhere in the middle of  the board, four sides if it's on an edge, or three if it's in a corner)."],"image":"game360_scr_Escapade.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":0}

(for Black on rank 1 or 2).  Evasive Moves:If the piece faces a piece directly ahead (to the North), then it may also move diagonally forward any number of empty squares.You may execute several such 'evasive moves' in a row, using the same piece. At the end of such a series of evasive moves you have an additional sliding move available.You may pass a partial move.  There are no captures in this game.  Variant 2: Forward, diagonally forward and sideways jumps are allowed over enemy pieces, but only if the move starts on one of the first two ranks.

All stones in a stack belong to the same player. Player take turns in moving one of his stacks. A stack moves exactly as far as it's high in a horizontal or vertical direction.  It is allowed, however, to split the stack in accordance with the move distance. E.g. if the piece to move is a stack of 3 and you want to move 2 squares, the top 2 stones will be taken to the destination cell and 1 stone will remain on the old position.   A stack may land on top of another stack, friend or foe, creating a larger stack (the sum of both). All stones in the resulting stack are then owned by the moving player.   The capacity of a board position is defined as the total number of horizontally or vertically adjacent positions. So, the corners have a capacity of 2, the remaining border positions have a capacity of 3 and the rest have a capacity of 4. When a stack's height is at or over the capacity of the position it stands on, it'll 'explode' (hence the game's name). I.e. each orthogonal neighbour receives 1 additional stone on top of the stack standing there and the exploding stack is reduced by the position's capacity. Explosions will cascade until all stacks are below capacity.     The name Explocus is a contraction of 'explosive' and 'Focus', the latter being a game by Sid Sackson (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(board_game) ) that provided the basic stack movement rules (stack height = move distance). The same stack movement is used in Dipole by Mark Steere. Explocus was the precursor to Atlantis, a multi-player game on a hexagonal board of arbitrary size and shape (see http://www.spelmagazijn.nl/nl/intvw16.html), which has become popular among the students of the Dutch \"University Twente\" in particular the members of board game club \"Fanaat\" (see http://www.fanaat.utwente.nl/) of which I once was a member.   This implementation deploys the (very simple!) evaluation function that Christian Freeling and Anneke Treep developed a long time ago, partly to demonstrate that complex movements (explosions) don't bother a computer player but is very difficult to envision by humans. Being able to look ahead a couple of ply makes the computer virtually unbeatable in this game. This in contrast to a game like Havannah, which has very simple movement rules yet deemed unprogrammable by the inventor.     Please note: When a game has ended, ZoG will display a dialog that announces the correct  outcome of a game.  However, after that dialog is dismissed, another extraneous  dialog pops up that always calls it a stalemate.  This dialog is not a serious problem, it's just an annoyance - simply ignore it.   This implementation uses the \"Axiom\" Meta-game engine."],"image":"game1491_scr_Explocus.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12,39],"variations":0}

In Frisian draughts the objective is to capture all your opponent's pieces (draughts and wolves).","Pieces move by sliding diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. Draughts capture in all directions, also orthogonally, on squares of the same colour. They promote to wolves on the back row (the Frisian name for the King is \"wolf\"). Wolves may move forwards or backwards on the diagonals. They capture in all directions (also orthogonally, on squares of the same colour) and land anywhere behind the captured piece.","The wolf may only slide three times in a row. Then he must be set free by capture, or by the move of any other of the same player's pieces. This rule is not valid if the player has only wolves left. In endgames with two wolves against one, the stronger party must win in seven moves, otherwise it's declared a draw. Stalemate is a loss.","It is mandatory to select the longest capturing line. If even, one must give precedence to the capture of a wolf. Otherwise, the wolf's capturing move has precedence. Thus, if a wolf can capture two wolves and a draught can capture three draughts, then preference is given to the latter. However, Frisian draughts is sometimes played with more complicated rules. Accordingly, two wolves shall be counted as 4 - (1/2) = 3½. This is more than 3 draughts, which means that preference should be given to the wolf's move.","Frisian Draughts is similar to International Draughts. The main difference is that both men and wolves (kings) may capture orthogonally as well as diagonally. If you want to set up a position, even if the program is not likely to malfunction, the preferable method is to choose the \"empty board\" alternative.","Can draughts capture backward? Yes.","Does a draught continue jumping after reaching last rank? Yes.","...and can he be crowned and continue jumping? No.","Can wolves move any number of squares? Yes.","Are captured pieces left on the board until after the move? Yes.","Must you choose the move capturing the most pieces? Yes.","...and if even, give precedence to the wolf's capturing move before the draught's capturing move? Yes.","Must you give precedence to the capture of a wolf to the capture of a draught? Yes.","Must you give precedence to the capture of two draughts to the capture of one wolf? Yes.","Discussion","The game was mentioned first time in a book by Swaanenburg, printed in Amsterdam 1725. Around 1750 Lars (Lorentz) Mollberg (1734-1772) visited his relatives in Amsterdam. Apparantly he brought the game back to Stockholm where he played it in the sixties. Carl Michael Bellman (1740-95; famous Swedish writer and lyric poet) mentions it in a poem from 1783, about the 'marquern'-playing corporal Mollberg. The game seems to have survived for a time in Stockholm, as Carl Johan Billberg mentions the game in his game book from 1838-39.","By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage generally leads to a win. But two wolves against one wolf is regarded as a draw after seven moves. A rule of thumb is that the wolf's value is equal to 2 draughts. If both parties have a wolf, subsequent wolves are of less value.","A good strategy is to try and get the first wolf, because this piece will cause a lot of damage to the opponent, provided he cannot capture the wolf quickly. You should try to hinder the opponent from getting a wolf, by keeping your lines closed so that he cannot break through. Remember that pieces can capture backwards, so you do not necessarily need to keep a thick layer of draughts in the last rows. Pieces that are too far advanced become fragile. You should try to keep your side organised in effective blocks, instead of spreading them out in many isolated pieces.","In my program, the Frisian rules are all enforced, except the seven moves rule in endgames with two wolves against one. The player can himself decide that it's a draw, with the aid of the moves list. Nor is the trivial wolf vs. wolf draw enforced.","I created this zrf since Frisian draughts on the Zillons CD is faulty (the wolf sometimes makes additional captures after the move sequence has ended). Moreover, the Zillions implementation of Frisian draughts ignores the rule that the wolf capture takes precedence over the draught's capture when equal in number. It also ignores the rule that wolves may only slide three times in a row, whereupon the wolf must be \"set free\"."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":3}

Frisian Draughts 2.0 introduces deferred orthogonal capture. It means that neither Man nor Dame can make an immediate orthogonal capture, but only subsequently; as part of a capture sequence.","A Man steps diagonally forwards. It captures in the four diagonal directions. It may also capture in the four orthogonal directions, but only during a jump sequence (\"deferred capture freedom\"). As immediate move, it may only capture diagonally, as in International Draughts. It lands on the next square behind the captured piece. When capturing orthogonally, it jumps to a square of equal colour.","A Dame slides and captures diagonally. It may also capture in the orthogonal directions, but only during a jump sequence. It jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A Dame may \"fly\" over empty squares (\"long Dame\"). The Dame must halt behind the last captured piece.","A Man promotes to Dame at the last rank. If a Man makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square and can continue capturing, it does not promote. One must continue capturing as long as possible. It is mandatory to select the longest capturing line. If even, one must give precedence to the capture of a Dame. Otherwise, the Dame's capturing move has precedence. Captured pieces are removed only after the move is finished. The goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces. Two Dames are sufficient for a win against a lone Dame.","Except for deferred orthogonal capture, the game differs from traditional Frisian Draughts only in these respects: (1) the Dame halt rule (2) there is no restriction in how many times in a row a Dame may slide. This game is also suitable for playing on an 8x8 board (\"Frisian Checkers 2.0\" 8x8).","History","Frisian Draughts (the forbear of this variant) is played in some areas of the Netherlands. It emerged during the 17th century in the northern province of Friesland. During the 18th century it became popular also outside the Netherlands, such as in Paris and Stockholm. This new variant is a proposal of undersigned.","Strategy","Notice that this game retains much of the exciting combinatorial possibilities of Frisian draughts. Although a Man can also capture orthogonally and backwards, it may only do this later, as part of a series. By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage generally leads to a win. A good strategy is to try and get the first Dame, because this piece will cause a lot of damage to the opponent, provided he cannot capture the Dame quickly. Try to hinder the opponent from getting a Dame, by keeping your lines closed so that he cannot break through. Pieces that are moved forward too much are fragile. Since a Man cannot capture backwards as immediate move, a good idea is to keep a Man or two as rear guards.

The  players take turns placing stones on empty points on the board,  with Black going first.  The object of the game is to form a  chain of friendly stones connecting two opposite sides of the  board.  A player can win by connecting the top edge to the  bottom edge, or the left edge to the right edge.  The four corner  points count in both left-right and top-bottom connections.   Diagonally adjacent stones are not connected.","Gonnect incorporates the capture rules of Go.  If placing a stone  results in the complete surrounding of an enemy group of stones,  with no holes in that group, then the entire enemy group is  captured and removed from the board.  Both friendly stones and  the board edge are counted when determining whether an enemy  group is surrounded.  The empty points adjacent to a group of  connected friendly stones are called that group's 'liberties.'   Capturing occurs when the liberty of a group is reduced to zero.   A single stone is considered a group of one.  Only orthogonal  connnections are considered in determining captures and counting  liberties.  A player cannot commit suicide by placing a stone  into a group whose liberties are reduced to zero as a result of  the move.  Capturing moves are always permitted and can never  constitute a prohibited suicide.","Gonnect also uses the Go rule of \"Ko,\" which is described in  detail in the \"Game Description\" section under the Help menu.   Unlike in Go, players cannot pass in Gonnect.  This means that  the two-eyed groups considered uncapturable in Go can in fact  be captured in Gonnect.  As the board fills up, a player may be  forced to drop a stone into one of two eyes in a friendly group,  thus permitting the opponent to play a stone in the remaining  eye and capture the group.","Gonnect adopts the 'pie' rule commonly used in Hex.

On account of this they are more chesslike than diagonal variants. Play is characterized by slow maneuvers, suddenly interrupted by explosive combinations. Whereas diagonal checkers only uses half the board (only squares of the same colour), orthogonal checkers uses the whole board. Gothic checkers derives from the Middle Ages. These old-fangled variants function very well and are quite entertaining. Also modern variants exist.","Turkish checkers (Turkish draughts, Dama) Pieces move and capture orthogonally, although the Man can neither step nor","capture rearwards. A Man may step one square. The King may","\"fly\" over many empty squares. Captured pieces are removed","instantly from the board. Yet, the King cannot reverse direction during a","capture sequence. It is mandatory to capture the longest line (i.e. it is","necessary to choose the series of jumps that captures the most men). Upon","reaching a promotion square, capture must continue before the Man is","promoted to King. Win is achieved by capturing all the opponent's","pieces. If players have one piece each, regardless of value, the game is","drawn. Sixteen pieces per player are positioned on the second and third","rank, from the start. Two Kings against one wins normally. Turkish checkers is often played on","a monochrome checkered board (8x8), sometimes using conical pieces rather","than checkers. Since 2014, World Championships have taken place annually.","Modified Turkish checkers The Men are positioned bottommost from the start. A Man can leap over a line of friendly pieces, provided that it is positioned on the first rank. It can then leap in any of the three forward directions. It allows many more opening strategies and creates greater variance. Otherwise it's the same as Turkish checkers.

The Man can neither step nor capture backwards. (Schmidt, W.)","Armenian checkers II Same as Turkish checkers, except that the Man can also capture orthogonally backwards. (There is no diagonal movement.) However, curiously, a Man cannot make a backwards capture as immediate jump, but only later in the series.

{"zrfID":437,"id":"grand-camelot","name":"Grand Camelot ","programmerID":6,"programmer":"W. D. Troyka","created":"2002-05-18","designerID":26,"designer":"George S. Parker","notes":"1932","description":["Grand Camelot is a four-handed partnership version of George S. Parker's famous boardgame Camelot. The original Camelot was invented by Parker in 1887, and Grand Camelot was released in 1932. To learn more about Grand Camelot and other variations of Camelot, please visit the web site of the World Camelot Federation at http://communities.msn.com/worldcamelotfederation.  Grand Camelot is played on a 16x16 board with 19 squares removed from each corner to give the board a roundish appearance. Two spaces protrude from each of the board's four sides. These are called the \"castles.\" There are four players who form two partnerships: Red and Blue versus Green and Yellow. The turn order is Red Green Blue Yellow. The object of the game is for a partnership to move two of its pieces into the opponents' castles. A player can move his pieces only into the castle on the opposite side of the board, called the \"goal\" castle. For example, Red's pieces can occupy only the castle squares behind Green in the initial array. A partnership wins when any two opponent castle squares are occupied. A victory for the Red-Blue partnership could consist of two Red pieces in the Green castle, two Blue pieces in the Yellow castle, or one in each. You also win by capturing all of the opposing partnership's pieces, provided your partnership has at least two pieces remaining. A draw is declared if both partnerships are reduced to a single piece. If one player loses all his pieces, his partner can continue to play, with the depleted player's turn treated as a pass. A player who has no moves forfeits the turn. The Knight graphic in the upper left corner keeps track of whose turn it is. If it is your turn and you have no move, click the Knight to forfeit your turn.  Each player starts the game with twelve pieces, consisting of eight Men and four Knights. A Man has three basic moves. It may move one space in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal. This is called the \"plain\" move. It may jump over a friendly adjacent piece and continue jumping, at its option, as long as friendly pieces remain to be jumped. This move is called \"cantering.\" And it may jump over an enemy piece, thereby capturing it, in which case it must continue jumping as long as captures are available. A Man may not canter and capture in the same move.  The Knight has all the moves of the Man plus one important addition, called the Knight's \"charge.\" A charge consists of a cantering move (or series) followed by capturing. Once a Knight makes a capture, it must continue making captures if available and may not return to cantering.  Circular canters, i.e., canters that return to an already visited square, are not permitted. Visited squares are indicated by flags, which are cleared at the end of the cantering sequence. To pass on further canters, click the piece and move it to the indicated off-board position in the lower left or upper right corner of the board. The piece will not actually change location.  Capturing is compulsory but there is no requirement of choosing a path of maximal captures. A player is not required to make a Knight's charge, with the exception that when a capture is directly available, the player may satisfy the compulsory capture rule through a Knight's charge. When cantering a Knight must make a capture if one becomes directly available but may do so through a charge.  Special rules govern the castle. Once a piece enters its goal castle, it may never leave. A piece in a goal castle is permitted to move laterally twice during the game. A piece can enter a non-goal castle only when capturing, in which case the piece must be moved out as soon as possible. If the piece cannot move out through another capture on the same turn, then it must be moved out on the next turn (even if this means declining a capture elsewhere on the board). When moving out of the castle, priority is given to capturing or charge moves.  The Green player was White in the original production of Grand Camelot.

Pieces have gender, can 'mate', give birth, age and die.  The game is won by the player whose population lives longest or who connects two sides of the board.","The unusual theme of the game keeps it fun whilst also enabling considerable strategic variety and depth.","BOARD AND PIECE DESCRIPTION: The game is played on a 6x6 board.  One player is Copper, the other Teal.  Male pieces are represented by triangles, females by circles.  Each piece also has a number written on it.  This is the piece's remaining life turns (lifespan) i.e. number of 'turns' left before it dies (higher numbers meaning greater longevity).  The remaining life reserve for both players is displayed on the left side of the board.  The life reserve is the supply of life turns that can be drawn from and allocated to pieces that a player introduces to the board during the placement phase.","TURNS:  There are four phases in each 'turn' (the last two phases being automatic):","Placement/Movement - Each player either places a new piece on the board or moves an existing piece.","Birth - Each player gives birth, if they wish, anywhere where the conditions for birth are met.","Ageing - All pieces age (their remaining life turns are reduced by one).","Death - Pieces that have no life turns left will die (disappear), and any player who has met one of the objects of the game wins.","OBJECTS:  The game can be won in either of two ways both assessed only after the ageing/dying phase of each turn:","If one player is the only one with pieces left alive.  This includes the other player having no reserve life turns (so a player is still alive if they have no pieces on the board provided they have at least one reserve life turn left to make a placement in the following turn.)","By one player connecting two sides of the board through a continuous series of their pieces which are all orthogonally connected.  For Teal, this will be connecting the two vertical sides, for Copper, top and bottom.","Please refer to 'reaper.pdf' for complete game instructions and examples.","Note: Grim Reaper is playable as a PbEM game at Super Duper Games:","http://superdupergames.org/","NOTES ABOUT THE PROGRAM:","When placing new pieces, the choice of available life turns of the pieces is restricted (e.g. typically 5 or 3). This is a slight deviation from the rules which was done in order to reduce the number of choices and thereby improve the effectiveness of the AI.","In some cases it is possible for multiple mothers to give birth at the same position.  In that case, the program will pop up a menu that allows the player to select which mother is to give birth.  This is an important distinction because females can only give birth to one piece each birthing time.","As of this writing, Grim Reaper is the most complex Axiom game.  Because new pieces with varying life turn values can be dropped on the board and existing pieces can move, the game has a fairly high branching factor.  In addition, the dual goals of survival and connection along with the need to manage life turns and the many phases, meant that   developing a competent AI has been a formidable challenge.  At one point during its development a neural network based evaluation was tried (See GRNN.jpg to view the network architecture). The neural network was constructed by creating a population of genetically evolving neural networks which played against each other in hundreds of tournaments.  The fittest networks survived and were transplanted into the program.  Although, this approach yielded a stronger opponent than the initial hand-crafted AI, an even stronger AI was eventually developed by hand tuning the evaluation weighting factors and testing play strength via the AutoPlay program.  What we found with the neural network was that one net would manage survival well while another net would be good at connecting, but we never managed to find a single net that was good at managing both goals."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12,39],"variations":0}

In this version, if a counter in its home position can make progress outward by jumping an enemy counter it must do so (a rule invented by S.

Here's the story in a nutshell: A late arrival.","Rules","Board The board is a rectangle of 9x13 squares, with two additional goals of 1x3 squares. There are two 'goal areas' of 2x5 squares. Both players, White and Black, have 11 pieces: 1 Keeper, 2 Lions, 4 Elephants and 4 Horses.","The diagram shows the board with the pieces in the initial position. The ball lies in the centersquare.","Object The object of HanniBall is to shoot the ball into the opponent's goal. If a player shoots the ball into his own goal, he loses the game.","Moving and capturing White begins and players move in turn. Each turn a player is allowed to make up to 4 moves, which must lead to at least one change in the position. However, white on his first turn may make no more than 2 moves. A 'move' may be:","Moving a piece that does not have the ball.","Moving a piece that does have the ball, with or without it (the latter barring the Keeper).","Shooting the ball.","Shooting the ball can only be done by a piece that has the ball in its possesion. The pieces move and shoot as follows:","The Horse moves as the knight in Chess, but may not jump to its target square if both the in between squares are occupied by opponent's pieces. A Horse shoots the ball 'king's move' wise. If a Horse shoots the ball, it lands on a straight or diagonally adjacent square.","Note that a knight's move is always possible between a cornersquare of the goal and the backrow of the field on that side (for instance b2 and d1), because there are no two intermediate squares beween these squares.","The Elephant moves as the king in Chess. An Elephant shoots the ball 'knight's move' wise. If an Elephant shoots the ball, it lands on a square one knight's move away, no restrictions.","The Lion combines the options of Knight and Elephant, so it moves and shoots either way in any combination.","The Keeper moves as a Lion, but may not leave the goal area (except for the goal itself). A Keeper in possesion of the ball, may not let go of it other than by shooting it (that is, he may not move and leave the ball behind). A Keeper shoots the ball up to five squares away, queenwise. Direction and distance are the player's choice, but the ball must land outside the goal area.","Inside the goal the Keeper or a defender should not have the ball in its possession, because a ball inside the own goal ends the game in a win for the opponent.","The Ball The Ball may land on any square, whether or not occupied.","If a piece moves to a square where the ball is, it takes possession of the ball.","If the ball lands on a square occupied by a piece, other than a Keeper, the piece takes possesion of the ball.","If a player is in possesion of the ball, and it is his turn, and he has still one or more move options left, than he can do one or more of the following:","Shoot the ball.","Move the piece and take the ball along.","Barring the Keeper: move the piece and leave the ball.","Move another piece.","If a player is in possesion of the ball, and it is not his turn, then the piece holding the ball can be captured by the opponent. Capture is by replacement. The captured piece is taken off the board, and the capturing piece takes possession of the ball.","Please note that if a player shoots the ball to an opponent's piece, and he has still one or more move options left, he may, if he can, capture that piece!","Shots at the goal or the Keeper","If a player shoots the ball into the opponent's goal, he wins the game. If he shoots it into his own goal he loses.","If the ball is shot to a square occupied by a Keeper of either side, the ball 'ricochets' off the Keeper, queenwise, up to five squares, but not into the goal (though it may land in the goal area). Direction and distance are determined by the shooting player, whether the shot is directed at a player's own Keeper or the opponent's Keeper.","Note that a Keeper can only take possession of the ball by picking it up in the goal area, or by capturing a piece there, that is in possesion of the ball. A Keeper in possesion of the ball risks capture like any other piece.","Obstruction Obstruction is a 'red card' offense against the rules. It is permitted, but may and usually will be punished.","If a player on his turn finds a position in which he has at least one piece other than a Keeper, and not one of his pieces can reach the ball in any number of moves, then the opponent has committed obstruction and the player to move may (but is not obliged to) remove one of the opponent's pieces from the board as his first move. This may or may not be a blocking piece.","If the obstruction is still in place at the beginning of the blocking player's next turn, it is up to him to undo the obstruction, or risk having yet another piece removed.","In this implementation, when you have a choice what to move,","e.g. hold the ball, shoot the ball or leave the ball,","just drag the piece to the target square and a menu pops up","to choose the right move from. I just hope it's clear enough.","When there's no choice the system makes the proper move automatically.","To punish a 'red card' offense simply click the opponent's piece you want removed.","Enjoy!"],"image":"game1735_scr_HanniBall.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":0}

Like checkers type games and Bushka, column checkers is about a simple two-men-three-squares scenario: put a black and a white man on adjacent squares. Now the white man can jump the black man, landing on the third (vacant) square and removing the jumped man from play. That's checkers type capture. Alternatively, the white man can jump the black man and taking it along underneath as a prisoner, landing on the third square. That's column checkers capture.  Now with a little imagination, one can see a man capturing several men as prisoners in a multiple capture. Next imagine this piece itself is jumped by the opponent: the guard is captured and the prisoners are now released! This released column can now in turn start to make prisoners and these will buried under several guards - to release them, the piece must be jumped a corresponding number of times!That's the general idea, and the most significant difference with checkers type capture is that no pieces ever leave the board!

Heximondas owes a lot to W. D. Troyka. The functional core of this rules file, the majority of the documentation, the audio, the game pieces, and the color scheme of the board were all derived from his work on Epaminondas for Zillions and are used with his permission.   The object of the game is to move a piece into the win zone. For the base game that is the three farthest hexes . In the Full Win Zone variant that is the entire far row. Motion in the game is performed by phalanx. A phalanx in the game consists of a line of adjacent pieces that moves together any number of spaces up unto the number of pieces contained in the phalanx. A phalanx that encounters a smaller enemy phalanx elimates the enemy phalanx.  When a player moves a piece into the winning zone, the opponent is given a grace move to equalize the situation by capturing the piece just moved or by moving a piece itself onto its far row.

All stones in a stack belong to the same player. Players take turns in moving one of his stacks. A stack moves exactly as far as it's high in any direction.  It is allowed, however, to split the stack in accordance with the move distance. E.g. if the piece to move is a stack of 3 and you want to move 2 squares, the top 2 stones will be taken to the destination cell and 1 stone will remain on the old position.   A stack may land on top of another stack, friend or foe, creating a larger stack (the sum of both). All stones in the resulting stack are then owned by the moving player.   The capacity of a board position is defined as the total number of adjacent positions. So, on a hexagonal board, the corners have a capacity of 3, the remaining border positions have a capacity of 4 and the rest have a capacity of 6. When a stack's height is at or over the capacity of the position it stands on, it'll 'explode'. I.e. each neighbour receives 1 additional stone on top of the stack standing there and the exploding stack is reduced by the position's capacity. Explosions will cascade until all stacks are below capacity.      HExplocus is the hexagonal version of Explocus, invented by Martin Medema around 1980. HExplocus turns out to be a bit friendlier to the human, because the bigger board and higher capacity makes play a bit more strategic. The name Explocus is a contraction of 'explosive' and 'Focus', the latter being a game by Sid Sackson (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(board_game) ) that provided the basic stack movement rule (stack height = move distance).      Please note: When a game has ended, ZoG will display a dialog that announces the correct  outcome of a game.  However, after that dialog is dismissed, another extraneous  dialog pops up that always calls it a stalemate.  This dialog is not a serious problem, it's just an annoyance - simply ignore it.

Troyka","description":["Hitchhiker Chess provides yet another question to science fiction's most famous answer:  Forty-two.  The game is based on Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker Guide To The Galaxy series.  It is played in a diamond-shaped galaxy consisting of forty-two squares, including a restaurant at either end.  In the center of the galaxy is a black hole.  The middle row of the board wraps around from one edge to the other.  The object of the game is to move your Hitchhiker across the galaxy into your opponent's restaurant.  You can also win by kidnapping the opponent Hitchhiker and dropping it into the black hole.","No piece can occupy the black hole, and sliding pieces cannot move across it.  A player must make a move if one is possible.  If no move is possible, the turn is forfeited.  Each player begins the game with fourteen pieces of six different piece types.  These are:","VOGON SPACE MINE","The Vogon Space Mine is used in construction of the intergalactic hyperway system.  Celestial bodies that block planned routes are destroyed through detonation of a mine.  Inhabitants are usually given three minutes notice, sometimes four.","The Mine moves one space diagonally or two spaces orthogonally, making its coverage a diamond shape.  When moving orthogonally the space traveled through must be empty.  It does not capture on white squares, called \"space,\" where it serves merely as a block.  The Mine is normally bound to space.  However, when it passes through the cross-galactic Mobius loop (the wraparound sixth row) it re-emerges on the dark squares, called \"antispace.\"  In antispace the Mine gains the power of detonation.  By clicking and releasing the Mine, it and all orthogonally adjacent pieces, friend or foe, are exploded and removed from the board.  Detonation of a live Mine can be prevented by capture but the capturing piece itself is exploded.","GOLGAFRINCHAN DEEP SPACE COLONIZER","The Golgafrinchan Deep Space Colonizer stands eight kilometers tall and is used for transporting useless elements of society to remote parts of the galaxy for resettlement under false pretenses of imminent destruction of the home planet.  On an unrelated note, chess variant designers beware!  A comet will soon be striking Earth and you have all been selected for salvation using the latest in Elbonian slingshot technology.  Stay tuned for further details!","The Colonizer moves to an adjacent square, orthogonal or diagonal, and captures by replacement.  Alternatively, it can plunge into the black hole and re-emerge in the mirror opposite square on the other side, capturing any enemy piece it lands on.  A Colonizer on c5, for example, can plunge through the black hole to position g7.  A Colonizer cannot capture an enemy Colonizer when plunging.","MAGRATHEAN ORBITER","The Magrathean Orbiter is custom built by the planet makers of Magrathea.  The Earth model featured here became popular after the ban on galactic cock-fighting.  The inhabitants that come with these planets are designed to engage in constant warfare for the amusement of their owners.  They provide a rich source of betting among capitalist galaxeers.","The Orbiter moves in a diamond orbit around the black hole, clockwise or counterclockwise.  It moves through any number of empty spaces, turning corners as it goes, and captures by replacement.  It is color-bound when moving in orbit.  The Orbiter changes orbit by moving one orthogonal space.  It cannot capture when changing orbit.","HYPERGALACTIC IMPROBABILITY ROCKET","The Hypergalactic Improbability Rocket runs on both traditional photonic drive and quantum improbability.  The improbability drive operates by making less probable the continued existence of the rocket at its current location and at all other locations in the universe save one, until the rocket rematerializes at the now probable location.  With this drive the rocket can travel anywhere within the probability matrix of local particles.  For safety reasons the rocket is not allowed to rematerialize within a certain vicinity of unidentified massive objects (\"UMOS\").","The Rocket moves in a straight line forward or backward and captures by replacement.  Aternatively, it can rematerialize in any \"safe\" square on the board.  A square is safe if it is not adjacent to any enemy piece besides the Hitchhiker.","KAKRAFOON SUN","The Kakrafoon Sun scorches the enormous Rudlit Desert, which serves as staging area for performances of Disaster Area, the Galaxy's hottest sound and light show.  The shows often climax with the sailing into the sun of a mock ship designed to trigger photonic flares that arc across the void to lick the desert.","The Sun moves in a straight line, orthogonal or diagonal, to an empty square.  It captures by \"scorching\" an adjacent enemy piece.  To perform a scorch, click the Sun and place it on the enemy piece.  The Sun does not actually move, and the enemy piece disappears in a ball of flame.  The Sun cannot be captured if it has just moved.","HITCHHIKER","The Hitchhiker travels the galaxy on 30 Altairian dollars per day and steals to make up the difference.  It is represented here by the traditional angel of food service, who brings good fortune to all those who bestow kindness upon travelers, and whose image is the favorite target of the skeet shooters of MaxiMegalon Four.","The Hitchhiker cannot move by itself.  Instead, it hitches a ride with an adjacent moving piece, called the \"carrier.\"  Specifically, when an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent friend moves, the Hitchhiker follows and lands in the corresponding square.  The corresponding square is the space adjacent to the carrier's destination square preserving the same relative position.  If that square is occupied or off the board, the Hitchhiker stays behind, although the friend can still move.  The Hitchhiker cannot be captured and it blocks motion by other pieces.  The space it is on can be moved to or through only if the Hitchhiker is carried to a different space as part of the move.  The game is won by moving the Hitchhiker into the opposite restaurant.  An enemy Hitchhiker still in its restaurant does not block a winning move.","A player can also win by kidnapping the opponent Hitchhiker and dropping it into the black hole, where it is instantly vaporized.  The opponent Hitchhiker can be kidnapped only if it is abandoned, i.e., not adjacent to any friends.  A player carries a kidnapped Hitchhiker exactly like a friendly Hitchhiker, with the exception that it can be moved into the black hole but not into a restaurant.  It is possible to carry both Hitchhikers at once."],"image":"game492_scr_HitchhikerChess.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12],"variations":0}

Also, a piece which steps into the corner square may later be promoted if the other corner has subsequently become occupied by a friendly piece.

There are three variants, each with its own tob:","4D Cross - a piece surrounded on four sides by friendly pieces.","5D Box - a space surrounded on all five sides by friendly pieces. The space itself may be empty or occupied by a piece of either color.","Diag - formed by placing a piece in a space surrounded on five diagonals by friendly pieces. The space must be so surrounded at the time the piece is played.   The Hyperspace board is 5-dimensional (2x2x2x2x2) and is constructed as follows: The two 2x2 boards on the bottom left form a regular 3D board. The two 2x2 boards on the bottom right also form a regular 3D board. These two 3D boards are connected through the fourth dimension, such that each space in one 3D board is orthogonally adjacent to its counterpart in the other. The two 3D boards on the bottom thus form a 4D board. The two 3D boards on the top also form a 4D board. These two 4D boards are connected through the fifth dimension. The entire 5D board is symmetrical. Any eight spaces that share two common dimensions may be considered a component 3D board, and any sixteen spaces that share one common dimension may be considered a component 4D board.  In the illustration below, the black piece in the bottom left is surrounded on four sides by friendly pieces, forming a 4D cross. The empty space in the upper right is surrounded on all five sides by white pieces, forming a 5D box.  Hyperspace is a placement game that allows you to explore the five axes of 5-space.

Dames (Kings) are \"long\" (i.e., can slide and jump any number of squares.). Game logic derives from Ed van Zon's HexDame and from Karl Scherer's Russian checkers. Although there already exists a Zillions standard implementation of Pool checkers, etc., it was necessary to create it anew, because all Zillions's implementations with \"long Dames\" (or \"long Kings\") are defective. (The Dame will erroneously continue a finished capture sequence in case two enemy pieces are positioned on the same diagonal, and the Dame captures from between them. Moreover, the Dame capture works incorrectly in Pool checkers, German checkers, and Russian checkers. In some positions it refrains from making the full capturing sequence.)","International Draughts (Polish draughts) is played on a 10x10 board with 20 pieces per player. The object is to capture all your opponent's men by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can move forward, by sliding diagonally to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in any direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. You must even choose beforehand the series of jumps that captures the most men. When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a Dame and can then move and capture forwards and backwards over any distance. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A Dame must also choose the line that makes the most captures.","Dam Lombok (Breakthrough) is played in Indonesia, and has also achieved some popularity in the Netherlands. Same as International Draughts, except that win is also achieved by becoming the first to promote a Man to King.","Canadian Checkers (or Canadian draughts) uses the same rules as International draughts, but the game is played on a 12x12 board with 30 pieces per player. Canadian Checkers was invented by the French settlers of Quebec, Canada. It was originally named Grand jeu de dames. It is unknown when the game was first played in Canada. The idea of an increased-size international draughts game is older still; boards with 12x12 squares were on sale in London in 1805 (cf. Wikipedia).","Sri Lankan Checkers (or Lankesian draughts) is the same as Canadian Checkers, except that the board is mirrored.","Dumm (or \"long draughts\") is played in South Africa. Dumm uses the same rules as Dame (International Draughts) but is played on a 14x14 board with 42 pieces per player. It is still played in Cape Town. (However, the old huff rule is not implemented here.)","Damii (Ghanaian draughts) is similar to International Draughts (board size 10x10). However, although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line (i.e. it is not necessary to choose the series of jumps that captures the most men). In Ghana, players use the huff rule, but this is not implemented here. Play is very fast-paced.","Nigerian Checkers (draughts) is the same as Damii, except that the single piece rule is not used.","Brazilian Checkers (Minor Polish draughts) is similar to Dame (International Draughts), but played on an 8x8 board with 12 pieces per player. If a Man makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square and can continue capturing, it is not promoted. This variant was known already in the 16th century, and possibly even earlier. It was a popular board game in Holland, especially in Amsterdam.","Philippine Checkers is the same as Brazilian checkers except that the board is mirrored. Players from Luzon, Panay, and part of Mindanao, play on the mirrored board. However, according to the World Dama Federation, it should be played on the regular board (same as Brazilian checkers.)","Pool Checkers is similar to International Draughts, but is played on an 8x8 board. Although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line (i.e. it is not necessary to choose the series of jumps that captures the most men). It is the same as Northern German checkers, which is played on a mirrored board. The first book covering German Draughts was the 155-page folio volume \"Die unterschiedlichen Spiel- und Vorstellungen des weltberühmten Damspiels\", which was published around 1700 in Nuremberg by Johann Wolfgang Schmidt (cf. checkers.wikia.com). In America, where it acquired the name Pool checkers, this variant has its own organization; the American Pool Checkers Association (APCA).","Jamaican Checkers (North German Checkers) is the same as Pool checkers. The only difference is the mirrored board. Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea. In 2013 the population was 2.715 million. A German population was established in Jamaica in the 1830's and some German words have entered the Jamaican vernacular (cf. Wikipedia).","Northern Slovakian Checkers is the same as Pool checkers except that there are only eight pieces per player.","Russian Checkers (Draughts-64, \"Russkie Shashki\") is the same as Pool Checkers, except that a Man is promoted to Dame during a capture sequence, if it makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square. Although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line. This variant is played in Russia, former Eastern Bloc countries, and in Israel. The International Draughts Federation (IDF) has adopted the name \"Draughts-64\".","Spantsiretti is the same as Russian Checkers, played on a 10x8 board.","Laotian Checkers is the same as International Draughts (board size 10x10), except that it is not mandatory to capture the longest line.","Ivorian/Paraguayan is the same as International Draughts (board size 10x10), except that the board is mirrored.","Swazi Checkers is played in Swaziland, officially the Kingdom of Eswatini. A Man can promote to Dame during a capture sequence. It is mandatory to capture the longest line. Pieces are immediately removed. However, a Dame cannot reverse capture direction. Board size is 8x8.","Note! In a separate ZRF I introduce variants with a special rule that serves to reduce drawishness: the Dame must stop on the first vacant square after the last captured piece, if and only if that piece is also a Dame. Thus, two Dames will always win against one Dame. I believe this is a significant improvement, especially for the 8x8 variants.

Variants implemented are:","Siberian checkers (8x8) (Turkutaga) The number of checkers are eight, placed on black squares. Both Man and King capture orthogonally, but move diagonally. Although capture is mandatory, it is not mandatory to capture the longest line. A Man can capture forwards and to the sides, but not backwards. Pieces are removed instantly from the board. At promotion, capture terminates and the Man becomes a King. The King may fly over empty squares. Two Kings against one is sufficient for a win.","Eurasian checkers (8x8) (Turkish-Russian) The number of checkers are twelwe, placed on black squares. The movement rules are the same as in Siberian checkers, except that a Man can capture in all four orthogonal directions. If the promotion square is reached, and captures are still available, the Man promotes and capture continues.","Hoogland Checkers (8x8) This game follows the same rules as International Draughts, except that a King can capture another King (but not a Man) orthogonally. It allows two Kings to win against one in the endgame. It was invented by Herman Hoogland (Netherlands) in 1923. The game, which was then called \"International Checkers\", was promoted by Hoogland's magazine Checkerwereld until his death in 1956. The first tournament was played in La Haye in 1930. After World War II it spread to 20 countries, but vanished after his death. The game was called the \"Esperanto of Checkers\".","Herman Hoogland (October 31, 1891 in Utrecht - November 25, 1955 in Utrecht) was the first draughts world champion from the Netherlands. In 1912 he became world champion for the first time, and he dominated the game for over a decade. From 1923 onward Hoogland became an advocate for a different way of playing the game (cf. Wikipedia). Also a 10x10 variant has been implemented.","Babylonian Draughts (10x10) This game once rivalled International Draughts in popularity. It is similar to the latter, except that the Man captures on the orthogonals. The rules used here are likely the correct ones, because the game is very good. Capture is mandatory and one must choose the longest line. If a Man lands on a promotion square during capture, it continues capturing as a Man. A Man steps diagonally forward, but captures in the four orthogonal directions. A King slides diagonally and captures orthogonally. It makes long jumps to capture, like in International Draughts. Captured pieces are removed after the sequence. In an alternative variant, the King both slides and captures on diagonals as well as orthogonals. Variants where captured pieces are removed immediately, have also been implemented.","Piece movement The object is to capture all your opponent's men by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can step diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in an orthogonal direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it.

The 64 square board is an 8x8 grid.","On the 36 square board, each player starts with 12 pieces filling his nearest two rows.  On the 64 square board, each player starts with 24 pieces filling his nearest three rows.","Play is by turns, each player make one move or one capture sequence during his turn.","All pieces move forward vertically or diagonally one square to an empty square.  Pieces can also move by hopping in one of the three forward directions any number of consecutive adjacent friendly pieces to the next empty square.  For example, a piece on c1 might hop friendly pieces on d2 and e3 to land on f4.

Capturing is not compulsory; a player may always choose to either move or capture.  Only the continuing part of a jumping capture is compulsory","Pieces capture by jumping or leaping.  Jump capture is like the familiar checkers capture -- the piece jumps over and thereby captures an adjacent enemy piece and lands on an empty square immediately beyond.  Jumping captures can be made vertically, horizontally, and diagonally forward and backward -- a total of 8 directions.  Jumping captures are multiple and a piece that can continue to jump must do so.  To leap, a piece moves a line of enemy pieces and lands on the empty square immediately beyond, capturing the enemy pieces.  Leaping captures can be made vertically, horizontally, and diagonally  forward and backward -- a total of 8 directions.  Leaping capture is not multiple and a single leaping capture ends the player's turn.","The first player to move a piece to his opponent's first rank so that it cannot immediately be captured is the winner.

Click the board. One square tile will be dropped at the centre, and seven tiles will be dropped on each player's rack. You play Red against Blue. Each player had 40 pieces, of which only 7 are visible. Each square tile is different (the full set of path tiles has 102 pieces).   The player alternate placing pieces by moving them from the rack onto the board. A tile has to be placed next to an existing tile, with colours of connecting path pieces matching. The system will offer you only legal moves.   If the tile you placed has two neighbours or more, you have a free turn. Note that in this game you cannot pass a free turn! The empty positions on the racks are refilled after every move.   You win when you own either a loop or a continuous path connecting two opposite sides of the board. Note that you do not have to be the player who completes this loop or path, it only has to be of your colour. If none of the player can achieve such a loop or cross-board connection, the player with the longest path wins. (The self-crossing pieces of the path are then counted twice.) Note that this program does not issue a win message for the longest path.   The win-condition checks the situation after each move in the following sequence:  - is there a loop of your colour?  - is there a cross-board connection of your colour?  - is there a loop of your opponent's colour?  - is there a cross-board connection of your opponent's colour? In the first two cases you win, in the last two cases your opponent wins. So if player Red creates a red and blue loop at the same time, Red still wins, because the system will stop after it found the red loop.   If one of the players cannot place a tile (i.e. is stalemated), the game is over and the player with the longest path wins. The stalemated player can click the name (RED or BLUE) at the top to signal the end of the game, and the system will issue a DRAW message, since the system does not check for the longest path.   Variant 2: here you do not get free turns.   This game uses a set of 66 tiles. Each tile can occur up to 10 times. Please note that there is an alternative piece set available.

{"zrfID":226,"id":"kalah","name":"Kalah ","programmerID":6,"programmer":"W. D. Troyka","created":"2001-05-05","description":["Kalah is a popular Mancala game commonly found on internet game sites, sometimes under the names Kalaha, Makalah, or simply Mancala. Its origins are murky but it appears likely that Kalah is not an indigenous game but rather a modern variant of the Indonesian game Congklak. The rules are as follows:  The board is divided into twelve holes and two stores. One player plays from the bottom six holes and the other plays from the top six. The stores are used for storing captured pieces. The right store is for the bottom player and the left store for the top player.  The game begins with four beans in each of the twelve holes. The bottom player goes first. A move is made by picking up the beans in a player's hole and sowing them one at a time counterclockwise around the board. Sowing begins with the hole immediately after the lift hole and continues until all the beans have been dropped. Beans are dropped in a player's store but not in the opponent's store. Unlike in Wari, beans are dropped in the lift hole on subsequent laps.  If the last bean is dropped in the player's store, the player gets another turn, which is indicated by a red strip. (You can get up to three extra turns this way.) If the last bean is dropped in an empty friendly hole, any beans in the opposing enemy hole are captured and the turn ends. If the last bean is dropped in an enemy hole or an occupied friendly hole, the turn ends.  The game ends when a player captures twenty-five beans or when all of one player's holes are empty. In the latter case, all remaining beans are awarded to the opponent. If it is your turn to move and you have no beans, you must click on an empty hole to award the remaining beans to the opponent. The winner is the player with the most captured beans at the end of the game.  In the variants, the players start with three, five, or six beans in each hole. A player wins by capturing more than half of all available beans (19 beans, 31 beans, or 37 beans, respectively).  Please send any comments or bug reports to dtroyka@justice.com.

The Red player has 15 red pieces, the Blue player has 15 blue pieces.  Players start with their pieces off the board.  In Phase 1 the players take turns to place their own counters on the empty corner points of any triangle, square or hexagon. Phase 2 starts when all 30 pieces are on the board. The players continue by sliding pieces along the lines to neighbouring, vacant points.","The following rules apply to both phases:  A piece can only be placed on a corner point, not along on a line. Pieces do not jump over each other, nor can two pieces occupy the same \tpoint. If a piece is blocked in, it can't be moved until a neighbouring point \tbecomes vacant. If, by occupying a point, a player takes control of all three points of \ta triangle, the player can reposition ONE of its opponent's pieces from \tthe point it is on to any other unoccupied point on the board. (NB You \tcan do this in Phase 1, as the pieces are being placed on the board). If, by occupying a point, a player takes control of all four points of a \tsquare, the player can reposition TWO of its opponent's pieces from the \tpoints they are on to any other two unoccupied points on the board. If, by occupying a point on a square, a player simultaneously takes \tcontrol of both a square and a triangle combination (a \"house\" shape) or \ttwo squares, the player can only reposition TWO of its opponent's pieces \tfrom the points they are on to any other two unoccupied points on the \tboard. The first player to take control all six points of a white hexagon, or a \thexagon of their own colour, wins! If a player cannot make a legal move, they pass and their opponent \tcontinues.  (I can't see how you couldn't make a move though). Both players have to agree a draw.

It is an African checkers variant played on a special pattern that is different from the well-known Alquerque pattern. Whereas the Alquerque pattern reduces the number of diagonals, the Kharbaga pattern reduces the number of orthogonals. The result is a different game dynamic. It is a very attractive checkers variant, not the least drawish. Although the number of squares is only 42, the many movement freedoms of the pieces make it a complex game.","Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. The pieces can step in the three forward directions, and capture, by the short leap, in all directions. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters. Counters are promoted to Mullahs (Sultans) at the last rank. If the counter, during a capturing sequence, makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square, it does not promote to Mullah. The Mullah moves and captures in all directions. It can move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, and land anywhere behind a captured piece. Capture is obligatory. Two types of variants have been implemented, one in which captured counters stay on the board until the capturing sequence has ended, and one in which counters are removed instantly. Note that one must always choose the line with the most captures.","A counter moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an enemy counter and the point directly behind is vacant, then one must jump over it and capture it, as in checkers. Several pieces may be captured like this in a single turn.","I have also created a variant where counters can move backwards. It's unclear whether this variant is authentic.

A Man can move forward, by sliding diagonally to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in any direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. You must even choose beforehand the series of jumps that captures the most men.","When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a Dame and can then move and capture forwards and backwards over any distance.

If a Man reaches the promotion square as part of a capture sequence, it does not promote.","The variant was invented by Christian Freeling.

You are presented with a double board. The left board has a Draughts-like setup and represents the Laska playing board. You move your pieces only on the left board. The second board displays in detail what is in each stack of tokens.   You start as Blue playing against Red. Blue has light blue 'Soldiers', Red has yellow 'Soldiers'. On the 7x7 board, each player starts with eleven Soldiers.   Soldiers move one step diagonally forward or capture an adjacent enemy piece by jumping over it diagonally forward. Jumps and secondary jumps are forced. (In the additional variants 3 and 4 only primary jumps are forced).   A single piece is considered to be a stack of height one. The top piece of a jumped stack is captured and placed underneath the capturing piece or stack. A column of several stacked pieces moves like on single piece. The maximum height of a stack is 18 pieces. On the left board special pieces with black cylindric base indicate that a stack consists of more than one piece.   Once a Soldier (or a Soldier on top of a stack) reaches the other side of the board, it promotes to an Officer, which can move and jump diagonally backwards and forward.   In this game Officers are marked by darker colours (blue and red), the Soldiers by light colours (light blue and yellow). A stack moves like a Soldier or Officer, depending on what the top piece ('Commander') of the stack is.   If after a jump you have an additional jump available, you are forced to execute this additional capture as well, and so on.   You win by capturing all your opponent's pieces or stalemating him/her. The Zillions AI plays Laska very well, so you can use this game to play against the Computer.   Variant 2 is played on a bigger 8x8 board. Variants 3 and 4:   Like variants 1 and 2, but secondary jumps are not forced. Variants 5 to 8:   Like variants 1 to 4, but you can see the left playing board only, the right board is invisible.

Note that in Mylaska secondary jumps are not forced.         Technical information:  Games with mixed stacks of pieces on board positions are notoriously hard to encode in Zillions,  because Zillions allows only one piece per board position.  This stopped me and other authors up to now to encode games like Laska in Zillions.  The dual-board method I invented here for Laska finally solves this problem and  might also be useful for encoding other games with stacked pieces.  One board is used for playing, the second board is used to display what is in each pile.

In his modesty, Lasker let his game without a name. The terms \"Lasker-Muehle\" (in German) and \"Lasker Morris\" (in English) were coined much later.  Lasker Morris is much more tight than traditional Morris. Especially, the second player no longer has an advantage. Lasker Morris was solved in winter 2002/2003 by Peter Stahlhacke, using retrograde analysis with 120 GigaByte of disk space and about 100 days runtime on a modern PC. The game is a draw.

During this phase the Ordinarii are commonly referred to as Vagi, or \"wanderers\".","After all the Ordinarii are placed upon the field, the players take turns either moving an Ordinarius or capturing an Alligatus.","Ordinarii are moved orthogonally to any vacant adjacent cell or they may orthogonally jump any Ordinarius or Alligatus to a vacant cell.  Several jumps in a single turn are possible, like in Draughts or Checkers.","An Ordinarius which is subsequently 'trapped' between two opposing Ordinarii becomes an Alligatus.  Such Alligati cannot be moved.  An Alligatus may be captured, removed from play, as a turn.","An Alligatus can be freed, if one of its two opposing Ordinarii becomes an Alligatus or moves away.  As long as an Alligatus is flanked by two opposing Ordinarii, it will remain an Alligatus.","A player can only move an Ordinarius between two opposing Ordinarii if this move causes one of these to become an Alligatus.","The first player to be reduced to only one Ordinarius or Alligatus loses the game.  Since this would logically prevent the player from creating any further Alligatus.  When a stalemate occurs, the player with the most pieces on the field wins.  After the placing phase, if there are forty consecutive turns without the removal of any Alligati from the field the player with the most pieces on the field wins.  All of the player's pieces on the field, Ordinarii and Alligati, are considered in these counts.  Three-time repetition of position is considered a loss.","So, place your Legion carefully.","'Hail, Caesar.

Alternatively, it may make a short jump over an adjacent counter of either colour to a vacant position just behind. Although the counter cannot step backwards, backwards jumps are allowed. However, it may not immediately jump back from where it came.","Jumps may be multiple and are not compulsory. As a bonus, a counter that performs a single or a multiple jump makes an additional diagonal step forward after the jumping move(s) are completed. You can always pass move, also during a jump sequence. Note! To also pass the bonus move, you must press \"Pass Move\" again. A player may not enter into the enemy camp while friendly counters remain in the home camp.","The name appears to be an amalgamate of French and German, meaning \"The Course\".

You play as Red against Blue. Click anywhere on the board to create a random wall maze. The creation of the maze might take a few seconds.   Then the players alternate dropping balls into the maze at any position except at an intersection.   The system will add balls of your colour at 'maze-adjacent' positions up to the next intersection. Once an intersection has only 2 open paths left, it does not count as an intersection anymore for the next move.   To compensate for the first player's advantage, the first player's first drop will not be expanded by the system, but result in only one ball to be dropped! (However, the first player can use this one ball to cut the longest path in two pieces, for example.)   The game is finished when all positions are filled. The player with the most balls (i.e., covering the most area) wins. To give the players some information who is ahead during the game, counters for the red and blue balls are displayed the right border.   The Zillions AI plays this game very strongly on the 15x15 board. (Give it at least 5 seconds per move). On the 25x25 board, it is clearly overwhelmed and needs at least 1 minute per move.   Variant 2: uses 25x25 board.      The name 'Maffy' is derived from 'Maze-Fill'.   Related Zillions game: Walls (which is a version of the popular game 'Boxes').  In contrast to 'Walls' (or 'Boxes'), in Maffy you have a nice maze given  as a playing board, which improves the board design and speeds the game up,  since the players do not have to construct the walls in a lenghty and  (on a large board) quite boring setup phase.  A further difference is that in Walls (Boxes) the players can claim an area at any time,  before a maze is built.  Finally, the special first-drop rule in Maffy balances the power between the players.

Counters can move and capture, by the short leap, forwards and sideways. Capture is not compulsory. Counters are promoted to Sultans at the last rank. The Sultan (King) moves and captures in all directions. Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters.","There existed two variants of Medieval Alquerque. In one version the Sultan can only move one square (short Sultan), and captures by the short leap. This was foremostly played in countries within the Roman sphere of influence. In the other variant the Sultan moves any number of squares, and captures like the King in international draughts, landing anywhere behind the captured piece. This was foremostly played in countries within the Arabic sphere of influence. In Sultan endgames, a majority of at least two Sultans is necessary for a win.","The above rules are much different from the rules of Alquerque as they have hitherto been understood. The most interesting rule is that capture is uncompelled. What speaks in this games favour is that it's more interesting than the traditional rendition of Alquerque de doze, which, allegedly, was played without promotion, and where capture was compulsory.","A counter moves to an empty adjacent point.

The only difference is the following: in a capture sequence (but not single piece capture), if the last captured piece is a Dame (King), the captor must stop at the immediate next cell after the last jumped piece. This serves to reduce the drawishness of the game, since it means that three Dames will win against a lone Dame. Note that, unlike in Killer Draughts, the halt rule is not valid at single piece capture. For this implementation I have utilized game logic from Karl Scherer's Russian checkers and Ed van Zon's HexDame.","The object is to capture all your opponent's men by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. A Man can move forward, by sliding diagonally to an adjacent empty square. It may also jump over an enemy piece in any direction to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible. You must even choose beforehand the series of jumps that captures the most men. When your Man reaches the other end of the board, it becomes a Dame and can then move and capture forwards and backwards over any distance. It also jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A Dame must also choose the line that captures the most men. If a Man reaches the promotion square as part of a capture sequence, it does not promote.","History","In 1922, Dutch champion A.K.W. Damme proposed to use the Dame-halt rule after the final piece (Man or Dame) only. Around 2000, Christian Freeling proposed Killer Draughts by introducing condition \"only after a final Dame\". In 2016, Juri Anikejev suggested \"Killer light\" (Modern Draughts) by introducing \"only after a final Dame in multiple capture sequences\".","An interesting variant was suggested by World Champion H. Hoogland, in 1923. The Dame may also capture orthogonally, like the \"wolf\" in Frisian Draughts. Thus, two Dames win against a lone Dame. (This is implemented as a variant.)","Modern Checkers (8x8)","Modern Checkers (8x8) is played on an 8x8 board with 12 pieces per player. The only difference from Brazilian Checkers (Minor Polish draughts) is the following: in a capture sequence (but not single capture), the Dame must stop on the first vacant square after the last captured piece, if and only if that piece is also a Dame.

The stacking limit is two and opposing stones may not occupy the same cell. A single stone occupying a cell is called a wall. Walls do not move. Their main function is to block the opponent's movement. Walls can be built up into towers.","Rules of Play Starting with the Roman player, the players alternate taking turns. On a player's turn he or she must perform one of the following actions:","Move a tower by distributing its two stones from its initial cell into the two nearest cells in any one direction (orthogonal or diagonal).

A Tower may also capture an adjacent enemy Wall by sacrificing its topmost singleton. Thereby a Wall remains on the original square. White represents the Romans and Black represents the Gauls.

The object is to capture all your opponent's pieces (\"Checkers\" or \"Kings\") by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves. Checkers can only move diagonally forward, either by sliding to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it.

Objective: To win, get any of your pieces onto one of your opponent's Octi spaces.  Each player starts with 7 pieces (pods) and 25 prongs. A move consists of either:(a) adding a prong to a piece(b) moving a piece in the direction of one of its prongs(c) dropping a pod on an empty Hexi space (some variants only)(d) making one or more jumps in the direction of a prong.  When jumping, you may choose to capture any jumped piece - whether friend or enemy.  Octi for KidsAlso included is Octi for Kids - a simplified version of the program which is easier for children (and computers) to play. In this version:- players have unlimited prongs- jumping an opponent's piece always captures it- jumping a friendly piece never results in a capture.

It also introduces ranged rifle or gun attacks as found in the Chess Battle variant invented in the Soviet Union 1933 by A.S. Yurgelevich. Having played that variant, I thought it would be interesting to create some gun capture pieces and play on a larger board. So there are pieces in the game which move and capture like traditional chess pieces, yet in addition they have the added capability of 'rifle' (gun) capture. That is to say, they can make a 'move' by sitting in place and indicating an opponent's piece to be captured along a diagonal or orthogonal, whichever the case may be. Imagine a rifle or big gun shooting at a target in a distance. That is what this type of capture tries to emulate. Notes on rifle capture: In the descriptions of the pieces, the terms 'gun' and 'rifle' are used interchangably; also, any piece with rifle has that capability in every direction, orthogonally and diagonally. Here are the ranges for the pieces which have gun capability: Helicopters-4 Tanks-3 Cavalry-3 Strongpoint-3 Infantry-2, Outpost-1.","Rooks, and Bishops (Tank, Cavalry); compared to their traditional counterparts (rook, bishop) these pieces (tank, cavalry) have limited movement. Instead of being able to slide in an unlimited fashion along open lines, each piece can instead 'leap' 1-4 squares. This means that the tank moves 1-4 orthogonally and can leap or 'move through' pieces along that line, and that the cavalry does the same along its diagonals. Remember that for both pieces, their gun capture capability is both orthogonal and diagonal.","The 2-star, 3-star, and 4-star generals have no gun capture but allow each player to approach the other's gun-capture pieces, by leaping into squares where there is no 'hostile gunfire.' These can be especially important when approaching the opponent's helicopter pieces, for the helicopters with their range-4 gun capture dominate the orthogonal and diagonal avenues of approach.","Blue goes first, then Red. There is no turn limit. Capture the opponent's 3 outposts and 2 strongpoints to win. A player left with no moves is stalemated and loses; in that case the last player who moved is the winner. Otherwise the first player to capture the other player's outposts and strongholds is the winner.","The back-lines: Each side's 1st rank is known as a 'backline.' The 1st rank is immune to the opponent's bomber and missile pieces. Some people refer to the back line as the 'bunker' or 'safe zone.' Note that this is a key feature to the game. The missile and bomber are by far the most powerful pieces in the game, so losing one or the other early on could be a big disadvantage. The lastline/'bunnker' feature allows both sides to protect these and the other less powerful pieces. If you have a bomber or missile available late in the game, and your opponent does not, it could turn the tide."],"image":"game1175_scr_Chess_Operational_2.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":0}

The goal is to transport your pieces to the opposite side of the board and occupy the eight central squares on the last rank. When a piece is placed there it loses its movability. In the first stage players take turns to drop pieces on the first rank. When all eight pieces have been dropped they may move one step according to their movement design, or jump over any piece in the same direction, provided that the destination square is empty. Diamonds move diagonally. Squares move orthogonally. Circles move in all directions. Triangles move diagonally forwards or straight backwards. Pieces are allowed to jump back to the previous square if they jump into the margin. This implies that triangles, in this special case, may move contrary to their movement rule. However, as it is only a take-back move it doesn't affect the game.","Pieces cannot capture. It's not allowable to place a piece on the side of the board (except for the destination squares). However, it's allowable to jump via the side of the board. It is permissible to move along the first rank and to place a piece on the initial squares so long as this piece hasn't left the initial squares. Multiple jumps are allowed and can be discontinued. It's only permissible to jump back to where you came from if the piece has landed on the margin (except the destination squares).","In Platonic Halma with \"advanced rules\" a piece may jump over multiple squares, as long as a single piece occupies the center square along the jump, and the other squares are empty. If the jumping piece is a circle, and the jumped piece is an enemy circle, then the latter is sent back to the first rank (or second if there are no free squares in the first). If the \"send-back\" jump will end in the margin (except the destination squares), then it is prohibited (a rule introduced in this implementation). A circle which is positioned on the first or the last rank is not sent back.","If an enemy piece, other than circle, occupies a position adjacent to a piece on any of the initial squares, then the latter is forced to immediately jump out (see below).","Note! When having performed a jump then you must always acknowledge that the jump sequence has ended by again lifting and dropping the piece on the same square.","If you have started jumping in the margin and realize that you cannot find your way out then you must go back the same way, since you are not allowed to discontinue the move, and place a piece in the margin. The same applies to triangles when they have jumped out into the margin and cannot find their way out. It's then allowable to jump back the same way, although this movement direction is normally not allowed for triangles. Should you end up in an eternal loop that goes back and forth, then the move is prohibited and must be taken back. This corrective movement, which only involves movement in the margins, is in practice never performed but is added due to technical reasons.","I have added an additional outjump-rule to prevent blocking of the goal-squares: if an enemy piece, other than circle, occupies a position adjacent to a piece on any of the initial squares, then the latter is forced to immediately jump out over the enemy piece, provided that the movement rule of the piece allows this and provided that the jump does not end in the margin. Circle's cannot cause outjump.

It is filled with oppression, class-ism, sex-ism, etc.  Thus it was essential that this game be brought into compliance with acceptable modern standards.","The playing field is now 10x10, the reason being that the previous 8x8 playing field retains so many bad memories and players should not be forced to re-live the abuse which they suffered within its domain.","There are no actual captures in this games, being a barbaric form of play.  But there are temporary displacements.  Pieces which are displaced from the field can be re-introduced to the field under certain obligations.  These are best known as Involuntary Time-Outs.","Both the DESIGNATED INDIVIDUAL and the SIGNIFICANT OTHER, being equal partners, move alike.  Each slides orthogonal or diagonal through vacant cells.  Neither piece displaces other pieces.  A displaced DESIGNATED INDIVIDUAL must be re-introduced to a cell adjacent one of the SIGNIFICANT OTHER. A displaced SIGNIFICANT OTHER can only be re-introduced to a cell adjacent a DESIGNATED INDIVIDUAL.","The GROUP THERAPIST slides diagonal.  But because this form of move un-fairly obligates it to half of the playing field, it is allowed to perform a single orthogonal step. A piece which is displaced by a GROUP THERAPIST is returned to its player who may re-introduce it as a move on any of that particular piece's initial starting positions, which must be vacant.  These position may be on either side of the field. This applies to all pieces which are displaced by the GROUP THERAPIST. The DESIGNATED INDIVIDUAL and SIGNIFICANT OTHER may be re-introduced to either of their starting cells. This particular obligation is seen as an attempt to give the displaced piece the opportunity to Began Anew. A displaced GROUP THERAPIST which is re-introduced to the playing field is allowed another orthogonal step privilege.","The SOCIAL WORKER leaps to any occupied second cell, but does not displace pieces from the field.  Instead it pushes a piece located in the target cell into an adjacent vacant cell.  If there is no vacant cell for such a move, it is not permitted to make that leap.  It may not displace a piece if it and the piece are adjacent the same CONFLICT ARBITRATOR.  And displacement of a player's AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL may result in 'sandwich' displacements.","The PUBLIC HOUSING is allowed to slide orthogonal through vacant cells. On the first move, it is allowed to slide nine cells. The second move, eight cells. The third move, seven cells....,etc. After the ninth move, it is not permitted to move.  All pieces which are adjacent the PUBLIC HOUSING are not allowed to move, although AVERAGE INDIVIDUALs may still participate in 'sandwich' displacements and 'frozen' pieces may be displaced by a SOCIAL WORKER.  A displaced PUBLIC HOUSING which is re-introduced to the playing field begins again with the privilege of sliding up to nine cells, then eight, then seven, etc.","The CONFLICT ARBITRATOR may leap to any vacant cell on the field, as long as it imposes itself between two pieces, regardless of player. It cannot be displaced.","The AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL steps orthogonal or diagonal to vacant cells. When an AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL is moved so that it is oriented with a piece between it and another AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL, regardless of player, that 'sandwiched' piece, also regardless of player, may be displaced and returned to its player who may swap out one of their AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL with this piece as a move. And this displaced AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL is considered 'retired' and may be re-introduced as a non-moving piece on any vacant cell of the playing field on a subsequent turn.  Retired AVERAGE INDIVIDUALs are still allowed to participate in sandwich displacements but they themselves may not be displaced.","The 'sandwich' displacement may involve more than one piece.  'Sandwich' displaced AVERAGE INDIVIDUALs are re-introduced as Retired AVERAGE INDIVIDUALs to any vacant cell on the field as a turn.  Re-introduced Retired AVERAGE INDIVIDUALs may perform 'sandwich' displacements.","Any piece which is allowed to displaced others can do so to either players' pieces. This is Equal Opportunity.","All displacements are voluntary.  No piece is obligated to perform a move which would force it to make a displacement.  Each player should feel comfortable to make their own Choice.","Game Resolution:","A player who has not any non-retired AVERAGE INDIVIDUALs on the field at any time has deferred their victory of the game.  This is known as the Non-Productive Resolution.","If at the end of a turn, a player does not have both their DESIGNATED INDIVIDUAL and SIGNIFICANT OTHER on the field then their victory is also deferred.  This is know as the Dissolution Resolution.","If all four CONFLICT ARBITRATORs are adjacent each other, all located in a 2x2 area, the game is considered amiably ended.  This particular pattern is known as the Agreeable Resolution.","Each player is allowed to pass on their turn.  This done by click on the Pass Turn symbol to the right of the playing field. If both players consecutively pass their turn, the game is considered over.  This is known as the Satisfactory Resolution.","Although players are obligated to move only those pieces which are initially located on their side of the field, this should not be construed as ownership.  This is Personal Mentoring.","PC Chess was initially created as a humorous example of the convolutions formed by those who would police ThoughtCrime.

You can: double up your  pieces so that a single move pushes multiple friendly pieces; occupy  corners and choke points that impede your opponent's progress; move a  piece quickly into your opponent's home zone, where the fixity of the  piece creates an obstacle; or quickly move all of your pieces out of  your home zone, leaving occupation of your opponent's home zone for  the endgame.

The goal is to transport your pieces to the opposite side of the board and occupy the eight central squares on the last rank. When a piece is placed there it loses its movability. In the first stage players take turns to drop pieces on the first rank. When all seven pieces have been dropped they may move one step according to their movement design, or jump over any piece in the same direction, provided that the destination square is empty. Diamonds move diagonally. Squares move orthogonally, but not backwards. Circles move in all directions, except the backwards directions. Triangles move diagonally forwards or straight backwards. Pieces are allowed to jump back to the previous square if they jump into the margin. This implies that triangles, in this special case, may move contrary to their movement rule. However, as it is only a take-back move it doesn't affect the game.","Pieces cannot capture. It's not allowable to place a piece on the side of the board (except for the destination squares). However, it's allowable to jump via the side of the board. It is permissible to move along the first rank and to place a piece on the initial squares so long as this piece hasn't left the initial squares. Multiple jumps are allowed and can be discontinued. It's only permissible to jump back to where you came from if the piece has landed on the margin (except the destination squares).","In Pythagoreic Halma with \"advanced rules\" a piece may jump over multiple squares, as long as a single piece occupies the center square along the jump, and the other squares are empty. If the jumping piece is a circle, and the jumped piece is an enemy circle, then the latter is sent back to the first rank (or second if there are no free squares in the first). If the \"send-back\" jump will end in the margin (except the destination squares), then it is prohibited (a rule introduced in this implementation). A circle which is positioned on the first or the last rank is not sent back.","If an enemy piece, other than circle, occupies a position adjacent to a piece on any of the initial squares, then the latter is forced to immediately jump out (see below).","Note! When having performed a jump then you must always acknowledge that the jump sequence has ended by again lifting and dropping the piece on the same square.","If you have started jumping in the margin and realize that you cannot find your way out then you must go back the same way, since you are not allowed to discontinue the move, and place a piece in the margin. The same applies to triangles when they have jumped out into the margin and cannot find their way out. It's then allowable to jump back the same way, although this movement direction is normally not allowed for triangles. Should you end up in an eternal loop that goes back and forth, then the move is prohibited and must be taken back. This corrective movement, which only involves movement in the margins, is in practice never performed but is added due to technical reasons.","I have added an additional outjump-rule to prevent blocking of the goal-squares: if an enemy piece, other than circle, occupies a position adjacent to a piece on any of the initial squares, then the latter is forced to immediately jump out over the enemy piece, provided that the movement rule of the piece allows this and provided that the jump does not end in the margin. Circle's cannot cause outjump. They can easily make it to the goal squares anyway.","In Pythagoreic Halma with \"simple rules\" you can only make short jumps, and there is no \"send-back\" rule."],"image":"game1185_scr_PythagoreicHalma.gif","category":"other","themes":[5,12,13,14],"variations":6}

Each player has 18 men and two types of 'markers'.  A marker has one or two vertical bars imprinted on its face.  A player's marker is the same color as his men.  There are two goal positions, one for each player, consisting of three locations.","OBJECT OF THE GAME: There are two ways to win in Quadrature.  One is to reduce the number of on-board, opposing men to two or less.  The other is to advance three of your men into the goal position in your furthest row.","BASIC MOVES: Players take turns making basic moves, one basic move per turn.  You begin your turn by moving one of your men one location directly forward, diagonally forward, or sideways to an unoccupied location.  If you have no moves available, you must sit the game out until you do have a move available.  Players are not otherwise allowed to pass on their turn.  If neither player has a move available, the game is a draw.  A draw can also occur due to repitition.","SQUARING: If you move to form a rectangle (henceforth 'rectangle') with horizontal and vertical sides defined by three of your men and one opposing man, you have 'squared' the opposing man.  At such time you must immediately remove your opponent's man from the board and replace it with one of your off-board pieces - this is called an 'exchange'.  Note that there is an unlimited supply of off-board pieces.  If the result of an exchange causes further 'squaring', then the current player continues to exchange pieces.  A single squaring and exchange can trigger a cascade of further squaring and exchanges.  The current player continues until no further exchanges are possible.  At that time, the turn is concluded.","You are not allowed to move a man to a location which is squared by your opponent. That is, you cannot move to form a rectangle defined by your moved man and three opposing men.  However, by way of exchange, you may add men onto locations which are squared by your opponent.","If, at the outset of your turn, opposing men are already squared by your men, you cannot begin you turn by exchanging said opposing men.  You must begin your turn with a basic move, and you can only initiate exchanges on opposing men which were squared by your current move, or which were squared by men which you added to the board during your current turn.","MARKER: If you make a non-squaring, sideways move while your marker is not on the board, your marker with the single bar, is placed on the board while it is still your turn. If you make a non-squaring, sideways move while your marker is on the board with the single bar showing, the marker is replaced with one that has two bars.  If your marker is on the board with double bars showing, you cannot make a non-squaring, sideways move.  If you make a forward, diagonally forward, or squaring sideways move, your marker is removed from the board.","For additional information, see 'Quadrature_rules.pdf'.","Quadrature uses the \"Axiom\" Meta-game engine."],"category":"other","themes":[5,12,39],"variations":0}

Troyka","description":["Random Links is a connection game played on a randomly generated board.  The rules are the same as for Hex.  The players take turns claiming an empty space on the board, with Red going first.  The object is to form a chain connecting the player's two sides of the board.  Red seeks to connect the two red sides, and Blue seeks to connect the two blue sides.  Blue is given the option of claiming Red's first space as an equalizing move.  As in Hex, draws are impossible.  One player will always form a winning connection.  Click anywhere on the board to begin the game.","The board is created by randomly dropping walls into a 15x15 grid (25x25 in the variant).  The only restriction on wall placement is that four walls can never touch at a common point.  With this restriction, the board is guaranteed to be draw-proof.  Four walls meeting at a common point are necessary for spaces to be diagonally adjacent (i.e., touch only at a point).  Diagonally adjacent spaces can block an opponent connection without themselves being connected.  This is the formula for stalemate.  When diagonal connections are prohibited, the only way to block an opponent connection is to form a connection yourself.  The only way for a player to completely block the opponent is to place a chain of pieces separating the opponent's two sides.  Such a chain equals a winning connection, meaning that the only way to completely block an opponent is to win.","Walls are dropped into the grid until no further drops are possible.  The resulting spaces can take a variety of shapes consisting of one or more unit squares.  When a player clicks on a unit square within a space, all unit squares within that space are claimed.","Unlike Hex, neither player has a theoretical win.  The strategy-stealing proof of a first player win in Hex depends upon the symmetry of the board when rotated from the perspective of one player to the other.  This proof holds that if the second player has a forced win, the first player can steal this winning strategy by placing a random stone on the first turn and then adopting the second player's strategy.  An extra stone on the board can never harm the first player.  Because the first player can always steal a winning strategy from the second player, no such strategy exists for the second player.","With asymmetrical boards such as those generated in Random Links, the lack of symmetry generally prevents the first player from adopting any winning strategy that the second player might have.  For example, on a 3x11 Hex board, one player has a simple winning strategy along the short axis -- play in the middle of a row, then connect to an edge on the next two turns -- that cannot be stolen by the opponent.","Nonetheless, the first player in Random Links will normally have an advantage.  There are three basic forced win scenarios.  Red can have a forced win regardless of who goes first, Blue can have a forced win regardless of who goes first, or either player can have a forced win if given the first move.  The random generation of the board requires that the first two possibilities happen with equal frequency.  The third option always favors the first mover and thus gives Red a statistical advantage.","In order to neutralize Red's first move advantage, Blue is given the option of claiming Red's first move.  This is accomplished by clicking on the first space claimed by Red and converting it to Blue.  This is similar to the swap option commonly used in Hex, with the difference being that the players do not actually change places.","Win detection is turned off in the \"Freestyle\" variants, allowing you to fill up the entire board."],"image":"game984_scr_RandomLinks.gif","category":"other","themes":[4,12],"variations":4}

The size of a group is the number of stones in it.","PLAY","Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty square. Then,","for every stone 'A' that is adjacent to your newly placed stone in one direction and to an empty square 'B' in the opposite direction, move stone 'A' to empty square 'B';","for every stone 'A' that is adjacent to your newly placed stone in one direction and to the edge of the board in the opposite direction, remove stone 'A', and","for every stone 'A' that is adjacent to your newly placed stone in one direction and to another stone in the opposite direction, replace stone 'A' with a stone of the opposite color.","The game ends when the board is full. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. If the board is empty, whoever made the last move before the game's end loses.","If the same board position appears for the third time with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw.","PIE RULE","The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.","NOTES","Repeating a position is very hard on a 5x5 board, and it is believed to be impossible on bigger boards.","Robble was inspired by Gekitai and Pathwayz.","The win condition and the pie rule are not enforced in this implementation."],"category":"other","themes":[3,12],"variations":8}

Besides normal tournament chess he enjoyed especially playing in simultaneous exhibitions. Once he participated against Dr. Emanuel Lasker. Hecker's game was the last, and Lasker took a chair to sit down for a complicated rook ending. It was drawish, but finally the former World Champion found a way to break through. In later years Hecker achieved several nice wins in simul events, for instance against Efvim Bogoljubow and Dr. Helmut Pfleger. On January 28, 2003, Erwin Hecker died in the circle of his family.

Checkers must be placed in the same configuration as they begin, although on the other side of the board. (So the three ranks of checkers must be shifted seven ranks forwards.) Checkers can step one square diagonally in any direction or jump diagonally forward over an enemy piece. There are no captures. It is mandatory to jump an enemy checker, but one can only make one jump at a time. It is not permitted to stalemate the opponent.","An optional rule is that the game ends after 120 moves.

Then each player calculates the minimum number of moves needed to accomplish their goal. Other checkers are ignored on the path of a checker when calculating the minimum number of moves needed to reach its destination. The player with the least number is the winner.","Salta (Italian for \"Jump!\") was invented by Konrad Heinrich Büttgenbach, 1899 in Germany. It became very popular in Europe, but disappeared after WWI.","Discussion","Salta, played with the original rules, is a tedious game that seldom reaches a resolution. Try instead the alternative variant, suggested by me, where diagonal backwards movement is disallowed until the checker reaches the three farthest ranks. Then it may also step backwards or optionally jump forwards or backwards over a friendly checker. (If the checker backs outside the farthest ranks, it can no longer make backward moves.) With the new rules it's more difficult to obstruct the opponent's progress, as one can only go forward until one reaches the other side. Thus, it's possible to reach a resolution within a reasonable number of moves.","Salta is a pastime game, easy to learn. Yet, it's not a game of chance, but still depends on good and bad choices. This is probably the explanation for its popularity in the early 20th century. Unlike checkers, it doesn't require much concentrative effort, and it can be enjoyed by young and adult alike.","References","Gering, R. (2001). \"Salta - The Humanistic Game\".

Jørgensen's game book from 1802 (\"Nyeste Dansk Spillebog\") a Scandinavian checkers variant called makvær  is described (pp.370-71). It is similar to Frisian draughts but uses an even stronger Dame that can slide on the orthogonals. This variant later came to be referred to as Scandinavian checkers. Sadly, it was incorrectly described by H. J. R. Murray, with the consequence that erroneous rule descriptions are now replete on the Internet. (These lead to a dull game that doesn't work.) Here follows the correct rules (although Jørgensen doesn't describe the rules in marked detail).","Scandinavian Checkers (or Scandinavian draughts) is played on a 10x10 or an 8x8 board, placed with the single dark corner to the right. The rules are similar to International Draughts, but pieces can also capture orthogonally, which is a rule that derives from Frisian draughts. A Man moves diagonally forward one step at a time. It can capture in all directions. (However, in the suggested alternative variants, it is not allowed to capture backwards.) Jumping over a piece captures it. Capture is mandatory, and one must always choose the line that captures the most pieces.","In the main variant, the Man may capture in all eight directions. (I have suggested two alternatives; in the variant with \"medium strong Man\" the Man may capture in all directions except backwards. In the \"weak Man\" variant the Man may capture only in the forward directions: north, north-east and north-west. All variants are quite good, but have different character.)","When a Man reaches the other end of the board (at the end of a capture sequence or by moving there) it becomes a Dame. A Dame can slide diagonally over empty squares and make \"long\" captures over empty squares, in all diagonal and orthogonal directions. It may also slide orthogonally, but on the dark colour squares only. (Thus, it is stronger than the \"Wolf\" in Frisian draughts.) Unlike the Man, it needn't land on the first empty square behind the captured piece. When making an orthogonal jump-capture, the capturing piece may only land on dark squares, while the other colour squares are neglected. Enemy pieces are captured one at a time, but several in sequence, if the position so allows. The objective of the game is to capture all your opponent's men, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves."],"image":"game2334_scr_ScandinavianCheckers.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":13}

The Sages try to kick the Fool into the goal on the opposite side. This wins the game. Pieces cannot be captured. A Sage slides in all directions, except diagonally southward. However, if the Fool is located diagonally southward, the Sage may move there to kick the Fool. A Sage slides and stops on a square in front of the Fool, which immediately continues in the same direction. The Fool can only be kicked in a direction which leads either to another Sage (of either colour) or the goal. (If this isn't the case, the Fool will not move when a Sage moves to kick him.)","Upon colliding, the Fool either bounces back toward the kicking Sage or deviates 90 degrees, in either of the two perpendicular directions. It may then continue to bounce on other Sages, but can now only deviate in the perpendicular directions. Only the first bounce is obligatory. (To pass, just lift and drop the Fool.) The Fool may stop anywhere on the later legs.","Importantly, the Sage can kick a Fool on an adjacent square by displacing it. (Otherwise, the Sage stops immediately before the Fool.) The Fool cannot move into the margin squares; but a Sage can move there. No more than one Sage can enter the friendly goal. A Sage cannot enter the enemy goal, but can pass over it. In the original rules, the first to score five points wins.","Here, White can kick the Fool all the way into the Red goal. The Fool will bounce back to the kicking Sage. Then it deviates to the left and hits the leftmost Sage. From there, it goes directly into the Red goal.","Discussion","According to the original rules, the Sage always takes the Fool's place when kicking it. But this means that it's possible to stop the enemy from kicking the Fool by placing a Sage immediately behind the latter. In this version, it can still be kicked to the sides. Moreover, when the Fool bounces back on the kicking Sage, there is one more square to land on. I believe this version makes the game more lively, and there's no reason to have the kinds of restrictions on piece configurations as in the original rules.","The original rules are better played with a rule amendment: The Fool may be lobbed over a Sage that blocks the Fool. The latter lands on an empty square behind the blocking piece. This can only occur if the kicking Sage is positioned next to the Fool, on the other side. In this way the Fool cannot be blocked easily. After the lob, the Fool stays where it lands and does not continue to bounce. This variant has also been implemented. Alternatively, the Fool deviates 45 degrees instead of 90 degrees. This makes the game harder.","Seven Sages (\"Les 7 sages\") was designed by Max Gerchambeau in 1980, and published by Jeux Robert Laffont in 1981.

The docks are squares marked by an anchor. A player can also win by completely eliminating the enemy's fleet.  On a turn, a ship may sail forward, turn, or attack. Ships can not sail backwards or sideways, but only in the direction their prow is facing. Nor do ships sail straight forward, but at a 45 degree angle.  A ship can move forward one space diagonally to an empty square. A normal ship may stay within the same space and make a 90 degree turn to face a different compass direction. For example: a north-ship may turn to face the east or west.  Ships attack and sink other ships (let them be enemies or friends) by firing a broadside discharge of the cannons arranged along the port or starboard sides. So for a ship to attack another ship it must have one of its sides to the other ship. During an attack, a ship will plow through the other ship to the vacant square beyond. (e.g. captures are made by sideways, orthogonal jumps.) If a ship can attack another ship, it is forced to do so. Multiple shots are NOT possible.

The board is five-dimensional (2x2x2x2x2). The initial board set-up consists of a piece in its portal surrounded on all five sides by friendly pieces.  The board is constructed as follows: The two 2x2 boards on the bottom left form a regular 3D board. The two 2x2 boards on the bottom right also form a regular 3D board. These two 3D boards are connected through the fourth dimension, such that each space in one 3D board is orthogonally adjacent to its counterpart in the other. The two 3D boards on the bottom thus form a 4D board. The two 3D boards on the top similarly form a 4D board. These two 4D boards are connected through the fifth dimension. The entire 5D board is symmetrical. Any eight spaces that share two common dimensions may be considered a 3D board, and any sixteen spaces that share one common dimension may be considered a 4D board.  Any corner space in a cube of n dimensions will always have a unique \"opposite\" corner that is n orthogonal moves away. In a square, it takes two orthogonal moves to go from one corner to the other. In a cube, it takes three orthogonal moves.

The winning color/shape could be one of a piece controlled by either player.","Order of play:     Play consists of two phases.  These phases are placement phase and movement phase.  In either phase a player could win the game.","Phase 1, Placement:   Players alternate turns placing one of their piece on an empty space on the board.  Pieces place consist of the type of piece placed, rather than the color of the piece.  For example, assume one player controls pennies, while the other player controls dimes.  Play would follow with the player who controls pennies going first, placing one of their pennies on the board, on an empty space.  The player who controls the dimes would then place one of their dimes on the board.  Player alternates until both players have placed all of their pieces on the board, or one player has won the game.  When done placing pieces, there should be 2 vacant spaces left on the board.  Important note: Each player may place one of their pieces on the board, either color side up.  There may be times where a player may want to put one of their pieces on the board the color needed for his opponent to win, rather than the color he needs to win.","Phase 2, Movement:   If a player is able to move a piece he must make a move.  If a player cannot make a move, their turn end and their opponent's turn begin.  During a turn, if a player can make a move, they must move one, and only one, of their pieces.  Players keep alternating turns until one player reaching their winning objective. (See Object of the Game section).  There are two types of movement, slides and jumps: A. Slide move:   1. A player moves one of their pieces to an unoccupied adjacent space, either vertically, horizontally or vertically (depends on variant). B. Jump move:   1. A player jumps one of their pieces over a piece, either theirs or their opponents, and lands on an empty space.   2. The pieces jumped over then is flipped over and its color (or pattern) is changed.  It is possible by jumping over a piece a player could cause a winning condition for their opponent.  In this case, the player's opponent would win the game.  In the event that such a move would cause both players to reach a winning condition, the players' opponent would be considered to be the victor.","Description of variants:  No diagonal win.  Players win only if they get a certain number of pieces in a row in a line vertically or horizontally.  The number in a row needed depends on variant. Diagonal win. Players also win the game if they get a certain number of pieces in a row diagonally. No diagonal movement.  Pieces only move vertically and/or horizontally (neither jump capture nor slide diagonal also). Diagonal movement.  Pieces also can move (slide or jump) diagonally. 4x4 board or 6x6 board. The 6x6 board leads to a more strategic type game. (N pieces each).  N = the number of pieces a player gets at start of game. N in a row.  N = the number of pieces in a row needed to win.","Closing Comments:     I found a used copy of Rubik's Magic at a flea market for 50 cents, along with some other games. I purchased it and found out  it was missing the rules.  Upon pondering what the rules might be for the game, I came up with the rules above, with the exception  of placing pieces down either color side up (I added this rule later).  I tried the game with other people and found out that it  played real well and people enjoyed it.  I later found out what the actual rules were to Rubik's Magic.  With the exception of the  types of pieces that are used, the rules I created for the game are almost completely different than those of Rubik's Magic.","I do want to thank Guenther Rosenbaum and David Wichert for helping to get this game implemented in Zillions.

However, the first player on his first turn must make","only 1 step and the second player on his first turn must make only 2 steps.","Each step includes choosing one of the player's pieces and moving it to","an horizontally or vertically adjacent square. A step may result in moving","some other pieces (including Rocks) depending on the type of the chosen piece.","A Stonetroll can perform two kinds of special steps that result in moving Rocks:","pulling a Rock and throwing a Rock.","A Stonetroll may pull a Rock that was located on the square right behind","the Stonetroll, i.e. on the horizontally or vertically adjacent square on","the same line as the Stonetroll's movement. After the pulling a Rock moves","to the square where the Stonetroll moved from.","A Stonetroll can move to a square occupied with a Rock. In this case","the Stonetroll throws the Rock in a horizontal or vertical direction.  The thrown Rock flies over empty squares and Dwarves until it hits an obstacle:","edge of the board, a Stonetroll, a Sorcerer or another Rock.","If the thrown Rock hits a Sorcerer then it lands on its square, the Sorcerer","with all other pieces of the same color are removed from the board and","the game continues without the corresponding player.","Otherwise the Rock lands on the last square before the obstacle (edge of","the board, a Stonetroll or another Rock). If this square is occupied by","a Dwarf then the Dwarf is removed from the board.","A Dwarf can push any number of consecutive pieces of any color (including Rocks)","standing on his path in a straight line if there is an empty square after","the last piece.

A player's \"end zone\" are the two most distant rows from that players point of view.","GOAL: When either player has placed all of their knights in their end zone, the game ends.  The player with the most knights in their end zone wins.  In case of a tie, the player whose move ended the game wins.","MOVEMENT: Players move alternately, white opens.  The knights move in an L-shaped fashion as in Chess.","A player must make either a simple or a compound move.","1. Simple move: A simple move consists of the player moving a knight to an empty square.","2. Compound move: A compound move consists of moving a single knight through three stages: Charge, Pounce, and Finish.","2a. Charge Stage: During the charge stage, the player moves a knight so that it lands on on either a friendly or enemy knight. This move can be repeated with the same knight landing on other knights.  During this stage, a knight may not touch the ground, only another knight.  For each enemy knight that the knight lands on, a charge is accumulated.  The charge indicator displays the total amount of charges accumulated for the current player.  The player ends this stage by pressing the \"pounce button\" (labeled with a \"P\").  When this occurs, the pounce stage is entered.  Note that the charge stage always ends with the knight ontop of another knight.","2b. Pounce Stage: The charge indicator now displays the number of remaining moves the player is allowed to make during the pounce stage.  It is possible for there to be no remaining moves, if during the charge stage, the player only touched friendly knights (in that case, the charge indicator displays a value of 0).  During the pounce stage, there are no restrictions on the landing square.  However, if a player lands on an occupied square, the friend or enemy knight occupying that square is removed.  The pounce stage ends once the charge count has expired.","2c. Finish Stage: The finish stage consists of the knight moving onto an empty square.  Note that this is not the same as ending the pounce stage on an empty square.  The finish stage is mandatory and cannot be skipped.  In all cases, the finish stage requires that the knight be moved to an empty square.","During a compound move, players cannot visit the same square twice, even across different stages.","Note: In the relatively rare case where a stage cannot be performed, the only move available is to remove the knight.","If a player finishes a move and the knight is in the end zone, then it becomes \"anchored\".  An anchored knight cannot move, be destroyed, or be jumped on during the pounce stage.  However, an anchored knight can be jumped on during the charge stage and when landing on an opponent's anchored knight, a charge is accumulated. During the pounce stage, knights can enter the end zone as long as they are not pouncing on anchored knights, and if a knight finishes in the end zone, it is anchored.","Implementation Note: In the original game, a player is not allowed to make a compound move which does not complete all three stages (e.g. Charge, Pounce, and Finish).  In order to better accomodate a computer implementation of this game, that rule has been modified such that if a stage cannot be completed, the only move available is to remove the knight."],"category":"other","themes":[5,12,39],"variations":0}

It was a popular board game in Holland, especially in Amsterdam.","Discussion","Most Western checkers variants belong to either of two groups, International/Polish or Spanish. In the former, a Man may capture backwards; in the latter only forwards. The problem with backwards capture is that the defence becomes easy. Although a Man advances, it retains control of squares in the rear. The problem with the Spanish group is that it has less combinatorial complexity, due to less capture directions.","Stockholm checkers keeps the advantages of both. Although A Man can also capture backwards, it may only do this later, as part of a series. It means that the defence becomes more difficult. A Man may sneak behind the back of an enemy Man and reach a promotion square. This vouches for a less drawish game. Moreover, the advanced and interesting combinatorial aspects of International/Polish variants are retained. Arguably, the introduction of the deferred backwards capture rule is a significant improvement. Worse endgames will become more difficult to hold. Although this variant is an invention of undersigned, the rule already exists in a traditional Gothic (orthogonal) checkers variant (\"Armenian checkers II\"), where a Man may not capture southwards as immediate move. However, here the strategical impact of the rule is less pronounced.","See also:","Winther, M. (2015). \"International/Polish Checkers Variants\".

One side plays the General (red marble) and the other side plays the Rebel soldiers (yellow marbles). The General and Rebels move by shifting along a marked line to an adjacent empty hole. The Rebels can only move in the direction of the Privy (triangle), or up and down. The General can move in all directions, but may also remain on the same square, provided that he is surrounded (he can then make a static capture). The object for the Rebels is to drive the General to the Privy and force him to the apex, in which case the Rebels win. Rebels may not capture. The object for the General is to get behind the Rebels, in which case he shall be regarded the winner (reaching the bottom of the board is the only win-condition). The General captures by two methods (1) static intervention: the General remains in place and removes two enemy stones that surround him, either vertically or horisontally (to make this capture, simply lift and drop the General). This capture can only be executed when the General is wholly surrounded and lacks freedoms, as in the initial position. Also a cornered General can capture by static intervention (2) deferred intervention: the General captures the pieces perpendicular to the movement direction, as he moves away. Press the start button to start the game.","The Rebels should approach the General in an effort to drive him into the Privy. In order to achieve this the Rebels must be prepared to sacrifice pieces. My Zillions program does not play well with the Rebels, but it doesn't matter since the Rebels should be handled by the human player, as it is much more challenging. With these rules, it is a surprisingly good and well-balanced hunt game. A simpler alternative is to allow the Rebels to move in all directions, which is also a good game, although it makes the Rebel's task simpler. In this case, the General wins by capturing a sufficient number of Rebels, so that only eight Rebels remain, for instance. The win-condition is different, while the game isn't constantly progressing.","Subjugatio Rebellium is described in Thomas Hyde's seventeenth century book. The rules, written in Latin, have been interpreted by Robert Reid. The deferred intervention capture is a suggestion of mine. In his book, Hyde clearly defines the static intervention capture. Evidently, deferred intervention capture is related to the static version. It's the same pieces that are captured, namely those that surround the General where it is positioned. So it is very likely that this is the type of capture that he meant, rather than normal intervention capture. In both cases it is the \"from\" square which defines which pieces are to be captured. Thus, the General can only capture pieces by being between them, not going between them. The rule of deferred intervention capture is substantiated by the fact that we are told that the General 'semper facit' (\"always does so\" - captures, i.e.). In this sense, capture is compulsory as it is automatic, but not in the sense of modern checkers.","Alternative variant: In this difficult (but probably not authentic) variant, static intervention capture can be executed also when the General is not surrounded. Normal intervention capture is here used (pieces surrounding the \"to\" square are captured). The object for the Rebels is to drive the General to the Privy (triangle) or to stalemate the General in a corner. The Rebels win if the entrance to the Privy is closed while the General is inside. Rebels may not capture and may not enter the Privy. The object for the General is to capture enough Rebels so they can't force him into the Privy. The General wins if there are only 8 Rebels left or the General manages to reach the bottom of the board (opposite to the Privy). The General captures by intervention, stepping beside two stones, either horisontally or vertically, in which case both stones are removed. The General may also remain in place provided that he can remove two enemy pieces that surround him, either vertically or horisontally (to make this capture, simply lift and drop the General). Capture moves are mandatory. Note that in this variant the Rebels can also win by stalemating the General in a corner at the right side of the board.","References  Reid, R.

{"zrfID":819,"id":"super-blue-gray","name":"Super Blue \u0026 Gray ","programmerID":67,"programmer":"Roger Cooper","created":"2003-02-02","description":["Background:This game is based on the original Blue and Gray by Busch \u0026 Jaeger, implemented by Roger Cooper in December 2000, but goes beyond the original game to address some of the gameplay problems that occured in the original game, plus include other variants to speed things up. The original game is described in Sid Sackson's book, a Gamut of Games. It states that the game was designed by Henry Busch \u0026 Arthur Jaeger. No further details are given. I have also seen the same game under the name of Cats \u0026 Dogs and Wild West.   Object:The object of the game is achieved by moving the Captain to the red dot, by moving it along the black line that runs throughout the board. Each player's Captain follows a different path to reach the red dot. This red dot space may only be occupied with a captain piece. No other piece may move onto it.  In some variants, you can also win the game, if you move your captain 3 spaces further along the track than your opponent. This variant is active whenever a regular Captain is used, as opposed to the Turbo Captain.   Order of play:Players alternate turns moving one of their pieces. Pieces move as described in the next section. Capturing is manditory, and is done by jumping vertically and/or horizontally. Multiple jumps are possible.  Pieces (names and how they move):","Captain (a circle with a + on it): This is the main piece of the player. It may not capture or be captured. It moves along the heavy black line one space towards the red dot in the middle of the board. The captain can't be capture or captured. If the next space is occupied by a piece, the captain can't move.","Turbo Captain (a circle with a star on it): This is similar to a regular captain but has extra mobility. This piece moves along the black line until it it can't move due to a piece blocking a space or it reaches the red spot (and wins the game).","Private (plain circle): This piece is similar to a non-king Turkish checker. It may move one space left or right or one space forward, but not along the path the captain piece moves on. When a Private reaches the back row of the opponent, it is promoted (just like in regular checkers). The Private piece is promoted to a Sargeant.","Sargeant (a circle with a dot on it): This piece move 1 position in any direction along any line including heavy line. They can't enter the red dot. Guards capture by jumping like in checkers. Multiple jumps are allowed. Capturing is mandatory.  Description of variants:In this game, there are multiple variants of different types:","Turbo Captain variants: This variant starts the players with a turbo captian, rather than a regular captain piece.","Super variants: This variant starts the players with Private pieces rather than sargeant pieces.","Classic variants: This variant starts the players with Sargeant pieces rather than private pieces.","3 space difference = win variants: This variant is only used in games where a regular Captain piece is used. If a player advances their Captain piece 3 spaces further along to the red spot in the center of the board, that player wins. This rule was originally in Roger Cooper's design and was kept to assist the play of the AI in the game. This rule was excluded from the Turbo Captain variants due to game balancing issues.","Light variants: The players play with half the normal pieces. This makes for a shorter game.","POW variants: This variant starts the players with their captain trapped behind enemy lines. The objective is the same as in regulard Blue and Gray, but the game plays out differently.  Designer Notes:I had seen Blue and Gray in Sid Sackson's book and it piqued my interest. When I had seen it, I had thought mixing checkers in with it would be a nature. I played it a few times and it worked. When I adapted my version of the game to Zillions, the idea of the Turbo Captain came about. With this came the POW variant idea.

Troyka","description":["Superstring is the latest installment in the \"nD\" game series, a collection of games designed to explore the unique environment of n-space. These games, including to date Wormhole, Hyperspace, and Skava, are characterized by simple rule sets that allow the player to focus on the interconnections of \"hyperboards.\"  Superstring is unique among the nD games in that it is cross-dimensional, meaning that its rule set works in space of arbitrary dimensions. The rules are:  The players take turns placing two pieces on the board.  Each piece must be placed orthogonally adjacent to the last piece played by that player.  Win by stalemating your opponent.  Black opens the game by placing only one piece.  The paths created by placing pieces in orthogonal series are called \"superstrings.\" A superstring snakes through n-space until entering a space surrounded on all sides, from which it cannot emerge. The first player so stalemated loses the game. There are only two superstrings in any game, yours and the opponent's, and strategy consists of forcing the opponent into portions of the board with limited space. If the board is completely filled, a draw is declared.  Superstring is presented in this rules file in 3D, 4D, 5D, and 6D, with the more intuitive 3D version the default. A description of the hyperboards is included in the strategy section for each variant. The game has also been implemented for 2D, hex, toroidal, and 7D boards.  The 3D boards are ideal for learning to think spatially. A superstring follows simple orthogonal paths along all three axes, and the players can focus on how those paths fill up the \"box.\" The stalemate concept also helps players understand the construction of the hyperboards. Because a superstring terminates only in spaces surrounded on all orthogonal sides, a player must quickly learn to identify how spaces are connected along the multiple axes.  N-space has long been familiar to mathematicians and physicists. As strange as the concept seems, contemporary string theory in physics, now widely accepted as the most promising path toward a unified field theory (the so-called \"Theory of Everything\"), holds that there are nine spatial dimensions (or even ten!) in the universe, at least at the particle level. The nD series offers a glimpse of these extra degrees of freedom.  Please send any comments or bug reports to dtroyka@justice.com.

Orthogonal capture is deferred -- neither Man nor Dame can make an immediate orthogonal capture. They may, however, capture orthogonally subsequently; as part of a capture sequence. It is played on an 10x10 board with 20 pieces per player.","A Man steps diagonally forwards. It captures only in the forward or sideway directions. Thus, it may also capture west, east and north, but only during a jump sequence (\"deferred capture freedom\"). As immediate move, it may only capture diagonally forward. It lands on the next square behind the captured piece. When capturing orthogonally, it jumps to a square of equal colour.","A Dame slides and captures diagonally. It may also capture in the orthogonal directions, but only during a jump sequence. It jumps to capture, but only one Man at a time. A Dame may \"fly\" over empty squares (\"long Dame\"). The Dame must halt behind the last captured piece. This brings the advantage that it is more predictable. Despite this it remains powerful, thanks to the many capture freedoms. This halt rule is known from several traditional checkers variants.","A Man promotes to Dame at the last rank. If a Man makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square and can continue capturing sideways, it does not promote. One must continue capturing as long as possible. It is mandatory to select the longest capturing line. Captured pieces are removed only after the move is finished. The goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces. Two Dames are sufficient for a win against a lone Dame. This game is also suitable for playing on an 8x8 board (\"Swedish Checkers\" 8x8).","History","This is not a traditional variant, but an invention of undersigned. However, it has a forbear in a Frisian variant played in the 18th and 19th century (\"Markvärn\"). Around 1750 Lars (Lorentz) Mollberg (1734-1772) visited his relatives in Amsterdam, from where he brought the game back to Stockholm. Carl Michael Bellman (1740-95; famous Swedish writer and lyric poet) mentions it in a poem from 1783, about the \"marquern\"-playing corporal Mollberg. The game seems to have survived for a time in Stockholm, as Carl Johan Billberg mentions the game in his game book from 1838-39.","Strategy","Notice that this game introduces many new combinatorial aspects compared with Spanish checkers, yet is not overmuch complicated. Although a Man can also capture orthogonally, it may only do this later, as part of a series. By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage generally leads to a win. A good strategy is to try and get the first Dame, because this piece will cause a lot of damage to the opponent, provided he cannot capture the Dame quickly. Try to hinder the opponent from getting a Dame, by keeping your lines closed so that he cannot break through. Pieces that are moved forward too much are fragile. Since a Man cannot capture backwards as immediate move, a good idea is to keep a Man or two as rear guards. Rule of thumb: try to keep your side organized in effective blocks, instead of spreading them out in many isolated pieces."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":4}

White has the first turn and players alternate turns throughout the game. On White's second turn, White must move the same piece that was moved  on White's first turn. On all other turns, for both White and Black, any piece may be moved.   This rule is intended to offset White's advantage of the first move. At each turn, a piece must be moved.  Players cannot pass their turn.","The non-jumping move consists of stepping a piece, Crowned or Uncrowned,  in a orthogonal or diagonal direction to any vacant adjacent square.","A formation of three or more Uncrowned pieces in a row, all belonging to  the same player, in an orthogonal or diagonal direction is called a 'Troika'.   If an Uncrowned piece becomes part of a 'Troika' after moving, it becomes  Crowned.","Instead of moving to an adjacent square a piece, Crowned or Uncrowned,  can make a double jump over two opponent pieces.  Crowned pieces can only jump over opponent Uncrowned pieces.  Uncrowned  pieces can only jump opponent Crowned pieces.  A jumping move consists of moving a piece two squares in an orthogonal  or diagonal direction to a vacant square while passing directly over the  opponent piece.  After making one jumping move, a piece must make a second.   The second jumping move can be made in the same direction, or in a different  direction.  A third jumping move is not permitted.  If no second jumping  move is possible, then the first jumping move cannot be made.  Jumping moves are not compulsory.

The two antagonists are the trolls and the dwarfs, the trolls","being few in number (but individually very powerful), while there are a large","number of dwarfs, but each individual dwarf is very weak and requires support","from nearby dwarfs to be of use against the trolls.","On the dwarfs' turn, they may either move or hurl one dwarf:","Move: any one dwarf is moved like a chess queen, any number of squares in","any orthogonal or diagonal direction, but not onto or through any","other piece, whether Thudstone, dwarf, or troll; or Hurl: anywhere there is a straight (orthogonal or diagonal) line of","adjacent dwarfs on the board, they may hurl the front dwarf in","the direction continuing the line, as long as the space between the","lead dwarf and the troll is less than the number of dwarfs in","the line. This is different from a normal move in that the dwarf","is permitted to land on a square containing a troll, in which case","the troll is removed from the board and the dwarf takes his place.","This may only be done if the endmost dwarf can land on a troll","by moving in the direction of the line at most as many spaces","as there are dwarfs in the line. Since a single dwarf is a line of","one in any direction, a dwarf may always move one space to capture","a troll on an immediately adjacent square.","On the trolls' turn, they may either move or shove one troll:","Move: one troll is moved like a chess king, one square in any orthogonal","or diagonal direction onto an empty square. After the troll has been","moved, any dwarfs on the eight squares adjacent to the moved troll","may optionally [2] be immediately captured and removed from the","board, at the troll player's discretion; or Shove: anywhere there is a straight (orthogonal or diagonal) line of","adjacent trolls on the board, they may shove the endmost troll","in the direction continuing the line, up to as many spaces as there","are trolls in the line.

One face has two arcs, Black and White, each drawn as  to join two sides of the tile which share a common corner.  The  other face has two straight lines, Black and White, drawn as to  join opposite sides of the tile.   Each player takes turns placing tile upon the field.  After the  first placed tile, all subsequent tiles must be played so that at  least one side is adjacent to another tile.  Sides of adjacent tiles  must align so that the colors of the connecting 'tracks' match.   The initial tile played on each player's turn is called the 'primary'.   If an empty cell on the playing field has two adjacent tile whose  sides present the same color of connection, the player must play an  appropriate tile to this cell.  This is called a 'forced move' and is  mandatory.  A forced move can result in consecutive forced moves.   If a move result in an empty cell which has three or more adjacent  tiles whose sides present the same color of connection, the primary  tile of that turn and any forced move tiles must be retracted, and  the player must attempt an alternate move.   The winner is the first player to form either a loop or line of their  color.  A loop is a closed path of any shape.  A line is a path which  joins opposite and outermost edges of the played tiles over at least  eight cells, across or down.  A player may actually win by an opponent's  move.  If winning formations result for both Black and White are  completed in the same turn, the player who preformed the moves is the winner.   Trax is an infinite game. It can be played with an infinite number of  tiles upon an infinite surface.  But for the purpose of this implementation,  it has been restricted to a 21x21 field with only 128 tiles.  This would be  similar to playing the game on a card table with two sets.   The first tile of the game must be played to the marked cell in the middle  of the field.  In order to retract moves, the player uses as necessary the  Back Up One Move button on the toolbar.  Drop a tile upon the field by  clicking on the desired space, the diagrams to the right of the field are  for the purpose of reference.    Trax was invented by New Zealander David Smith in 1980. The game was first published in New Zealand and the USA in 1981.   For more information about Trax visit: www.traxgame.com  Copyright 2002 David Smith  [Trax@xtra.co.nz].

It means that it is trickier to defend against intruders. A Man may sneak behind the back of an enemy Man and capture it from behind, or reach a promotion square. Arguably, it is a good idea to keep a Man or two as rear guards. However, the rule could also be used to attack a vanguard, since it cannot immediately capture a Man that attacks from behind. In International Draughts, it is difficult to win with three Kings against one. Diverse halt rules have been proposed as a remedy. The vanguard rule is preferably combined with any of four different halt rules (cf. Winther, 2017a, here)","Piece movement","A Man steps diagonally forwards.

In the beginning the board is empty and the stones are put in reach for both players. The players choose their colors. Light makes the first move, then players take turns.","Play","In each turn a player must try to enter a stone (with his own color facing up) on an empty space. If a stone is placed such that exactly one opponent stone is orthogonally or diagonally between the entered stone and another friendly stone, then this opponent stone is flipped and becomes a friendly stone. This is called a capture. Now the entered stone must be used as the starting point to capture another opponent stone and so on until no further capture is available. Capturing is not mandatory, but if a capture move is made, any capture moves which follow must be made, too. It is not necessary to always follow the path where a maximum of captures is possible. A capture move is similar to a capture move in Checkers. It is like jumping over one opponent stone, but here no stone is moved and a captured stone is not removed (it is flipped instead). Instead of capturing, a player can enter a single stone on an arbitrary empty space. However, it is not allowed to enter a stone (orthogonally or diagonally) next to a friendly stone if there isn't also an opponent stone adjacent to that new stone. Lastly, stones may only be entered on corner spaces if there is another (opponent) stone (orthogonally or diagonally) adjacent. If a player cannot make a capture and cannot enter a stone, he must pass. The other player will always have a move available.","End of the Game","The game ends when the board is completely filled.

It is known by a variety of regional names, including Awari, Oware, Awale, Woro, and Ayo, and it is played throughout Africa and the West Indies. The rules are as follows:  The board is divided into twelve holes and two stores. One player plays from the bottom six holes and the other plays from the top six. The stores are used for storing captured pieces -- called beans -- and do not play a role in the game. The right store is for the bottom player and the left store for the top player.  The game begins with four beans in each of the twelve holes. The bottom player goes first. A move is made by picking up the beans in a player's hole and sowing them one at a time counterclockwise around the board. Sowing begins with the hole immediately after the lift hole and continues until all the beans have been dropped. If twelve or more beans are sown, the lift hole is skipped over and remains empty at the end of the turn.  If the last piece dropped by a player lands in an opponent hole that contains two or three beans (including any dropped beans), those beans are captured and placed in the player's store. If the captured hole is preceded by an unbroken chain of one or more enemy holes containing two or three beans, those beans are also captured.  If all of the opponent's holes are empty, you must make a move that gives at least one bean to the opponent, unless no other move is available. If you make a move that would normally capture all opponent beans, no captures result.  The game ends when a player captures twenty-five beans or when a player has no move because all of that player's holes are empty. In the latter case, all remaining pieces are awarded to the opponent. If it is your turn to move and you have no beans, you must click on an empty hole to award the remaining beans to the opponent. The winner is the player with the most captured beans at the end of the game.  For a generic game engine, Zillions plays Wari remarkably well.

The Zamma board is quite old. It is believed to be the precursor of the Alquerque board pattern. A Zamma board survives among the roof-slab scribings at Kurna (c. 1400 BCE). However, the present version of Zamma is believed to rely heavily on developments in draughts since the 17th century. It is still played in North Africa, where the black pieces are called men, and the white pieces are called women. When played in the Sahara, the men are represented by short sticks, whilst the women are pieces of camel dung. Black makes the first move.","This game is called Srand (or Dhamet) in Mauritania, where it is the national game. In the particular variant played the captured counters are removed instantly from the board. In other variants the removal of captured pieces is deferred.","Pieces are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. They can only move in the forward directions, however, they can make multiple captures, by the short leap, in any direction. Goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces. Note that one must always choose the line with the most captures. Pieces are promoted to Mullahs (also called Sultans) at the last rank. If the counter, during a capturing sequence, makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square, it does not promote to Mullah. The Mullah moves and captures in all directions. It can move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, and land anywhere behind the captured piece. In one variant it cannot jump repeatedly over an enemy piece, in another variant it can (that is, the captured piece has already been removed). Capture is compulsory.","A piece moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an enemy piece and the point directly behind is vacant, then one must jump over it and capture it, as in checkers. Several pieces may be captured like this in a single turn.","Two smaller Zamma variants have also been implemented, namely Kreïbga (5x5), where pieces can both move and capture in all directions, and the minimalistic Felli (Fich) from Marocko.","A thanks to Peter Michaelsen for providing much valuable information."],"category":"other","themes":[2,12],"variations":3}

In the Battle of Thermopylae, which occurred in August 480 BC[1] (and was detailed almost entirely by Herodotus), an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian Empire at the pass of Thermopylae in central Greece. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the Persians for three days in one of history's most famous last stands. A small force led by King Leonidas I of Sparta blocked the only road through which the massive army of Xerxes I of Persia could pass. After three days of battle, a local resident named Ephialtes is believed to have betrayed the Greeks by revealing a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King Leonidas stayed behind with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespian volunteers, 400 Thebans who may have been pressed into service, and 900 Helots.","The Persians succeeded in taking the pass but sustained losses disproportionate to those of the Greeks. The fierce resistance of the Spartan-led army offered Athens the invaluable time to prepare for a decisive naval battle that would determine the outcome of the war. The subsequent Greek victory at the Battle of Salamis left much of the Persian Empire's navy destroyed and Xerxes retreated to Asia, leaving a force in Greece under Mardonius, who was to complete the subjugation of the Greeks. The Spartans assembled at full strength and led a pan-Greek army that defeated the main Persian force at the Battle of Plataea. This battle ended the Greco-Persian War and the expansion of the Persian Empire into Europe.","Both ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the superior power of a patriotic army of freemen defending native soil. The performance of the defenders at the battle of Thermopylae is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers, and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds."],"image":"game1639_scr_300_Spartans.gif","category":"other","themes":[2,12,37],"variations":2}
